"Doluna" is shrouded in a veil 
of mystery; a kingdom of 
Manaketes. [MapWaitForA]
Everything started with the 
resurrection of the Shadow 
Dragon, Medeus, at this 
country. [MapWaitForA]
The continent of Akaneia was 
ruined from endless warring. [MapWaitForA]
Many tragic tales have been 
born and destroyed. [MapWaitForA]
But time flows fast. [MapWaitForA]
Medeus's ambitions, of 
Manaketes ruling the world, 
must finally end. [MapWaitForA]
And Marth's journey must also 
reach its final destination. # length: 444
