The surprising truth from 
Xane was a shock to Marth. [MapWaitForA]
Tiki was created as the 
daughter of the Divine Dragon 
King, Naga, and slept in the 
temple because of the king's [MapWaitForA]
will. [MapWaitForA]
The king's fear of Tiki's power 
was that of a loving father's. [MapWaitForA]
If Tiki was to awaken, her 
tremendous power would 
eventually cause the 
destruction of the world... [MapWaitForA]
That is what the Divine Dragon 
King feared. [MapWaitForA]
However, Bantu, the king's 
servant, became attached to 
Tiki after watching over her 
for a period of hundreds of [MapWaitForA]
years. [MapWaitForA]
He awoke her from her sleep, 
and took her away. So Tiki only 
had 10 human years worth of 
memory... [MapWaitForA]
"That is so sad, Tiki..." Marth 
was too bewildered to think. # length: 708
