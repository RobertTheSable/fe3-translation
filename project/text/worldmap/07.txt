After accepting Catria's 
request, Prince Marth headed 
to rescue the captive 
Princess Maria of Medon. [MapWaitForA]
And so, decided to mount an 
attack on Deil prison. [MapWaitForA]
Within the allied army, many 
suggested it was a trap set by 
General Minerva. [MapWaitForA]
But Prince Marth believed 
that, in the battle of 
Lefcandith, he saw a gentle 
female. [MapWaitForA]
And it wasn't the fearful 
enemy that everybody 
described. [MapWaitForA]
That person had the same 
expression as his elder 
sister... A tragic and painful 
one... [MapWaitForA]
From Minerva, Marth saw the 
figure of his elder sister, 
Elice, [MapWaitForA]
who was still missing after 
being captured by the Empire 
in place of him. [MapWaitForA]
Princess Maria must be 
rescued. Then perhaps that 
person can also be saved... [MapWaitForA]
Marth's heart was decided 
upon this action. # length: 780
