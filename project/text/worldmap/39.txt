Saint Akaneia is the largest 
country on the continent. [MapWaitForA]
Its golden capital of Pales has 
bathed in 600 years of proud 
history. [MapWaitForA]
Under the attack of Altea's 
allied army, it fell in just one 
day. [MapWaitForA]
The citizens of Akaneia 
welcomed them as liberators, 
and supported them to their 
fullest. [MapWaitForA]
They also mentioned of their 
hatred towards Hardin and his 
personal guards. [MapWaitForA]
Everybody now calls Hardin 
the Dark Emperor. This was in 
hatred of Hardin, the murderer 
of countless people. [MapWaitForA]
If possible fighting would be 
avoided, but it has already 
reached this stage... [MapWaitForA]
Marth raises Anri's flag up 
high, and orders his last 
command. [MapWaitForA]
Go, heroes of Altea! This is 
the final battle. Everybody, 
charge into Pales Castle!! # length: 750
