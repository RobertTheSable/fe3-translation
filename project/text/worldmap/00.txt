Prince Marth of Altea was 
chased out of his homeland by 
the Dolunian Empire.[MapWaitForA]
He was protected by the 
Altean knights, led by the 
veteran knight, Jagen.[MapWaitForA]
And he escaped, after much 
struggle, to the eastern island 
kingdom of Talys. [MapWaitForA]
The Kingdom of Talys was a 
small country, without even 
its own knights, located at the 
frontier. [MapWaitForA]
The King of Talys lent his 
eastern fortress to Marth, 
and offered him assistance. [MapWaitForA]
After the death of both his 
parents, and his beloved 
sister's capture, by the 
Empire, Marth felt anxious. [MapWaitForA]
"Prince Marth... I understand 
your concern for your sister.[MapWaitForA]
However you're only 14. 
You're too young to fight with 
the Empire. [MapWaitForA]
Please wait for now. 
Here you can train, until you 
become strong enough..."[MapWaitForA]
Under the caring protection of 
the Talys citizens, Marth had 
passed 2 years at this 
country. [MapWaitForA]
Right now, it is fast 
approaching the day that he 
becomes 16 years of age... # length: 952
