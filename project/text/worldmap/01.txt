Across the shore from the 
Kingdom of Talys is Galder 
port. [MapWaitForA]
For a long time it has been a 
poor, but peaceful port town. [MapWaitForA]
One day it was suddenly 
attacked by a pirate gang and 
it has since become their base. [MapWaitForA]
From Galder port, Marth begins 
the first steps to liberating 
his homeland. # length: 302
