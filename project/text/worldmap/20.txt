One year has passed since the 
War of Darkness ended. [MapWaitForA]
Thanks to the efforts of 
Prince Marth, the Kingdom of 
Altea, devastated by war, 
finally begins to stabilise. [MapWaitForA]
The knight Jagen, who 
succeeded the ill Malledus, 
became the prince's tactician 
and helped him rule the [MapWaitForA]
country, by his side. [MapWaitForA]
Afterwards, Princess Shiida 
was welcomed to Altea, and her 
marriage with Prince Marth 
was announced. [MapWaitForA]
The citizens of Altea were 
happy for the pair's fortune 
and Shiida was passionately 
welcomed to the country. [MapWaitForA]
However... [MapWaitForA]
Nearing the day of the 
wedding, a letter suddenly 
comes from the imperial palace 
of Pales, containing an [MapWaitForA]
imperial order. [MapWaitForA]
"Dear Prince Marth of Altea, [MapWaitForA]
At the Kingdom of Grust, 
occupied by Akaneia, a huge 
rebellion has broken out. [MapWaitForA]
I request for your country to 
subdue Grust. [MapWaitForA]
Your highness, please send 
Altea's full army immediately, 
to quell Grust's rebellion."
Emperor Hardin. [MapWaitForA]
The Kingdom of Akaneia is the 
suzerain state to Altea, and 
its orders must be followed. [MapWaitForA]
The helpless Marth orders the 
knight Cain to protect his 
kingdom. [MapWaitForA]
And he leaves, along with 
Jagen and the others, to an 
expedition to Grust.# length: 1200
