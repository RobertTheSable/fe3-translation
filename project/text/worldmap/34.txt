Marth and the others were 
transported to Altea's 
outskirts by Gotoh's magic. [MapWaitForA]
They were ready to begin the 
battle to reclaim their 
homeland. [MapWaitForA]
The commander of Akaneia's 
army, General Eibel, had 
ordered the Gra Knights to 
charge, to buy time. [MapWaitForA]
At the same time he prepared 
many dishonourable tactics, 
and waited for the chance to 
defeat Altea's army in one [MapWaitForA]
swift blow. [MapWaitForA]
Before his fond homeland, 
Marth's battles were about to 
begin once again. [MapWaitForA]
"We will reclaim our capital of 
Anri!! We will reclaim our 
homeland!!" [MapWaitForA]
Prince Marth's voice 
resounded through Altea's 
skies. [MapWaitForA]
They had travelled a difficult 
journey, but their destination 
was finally reached. # length: 701
