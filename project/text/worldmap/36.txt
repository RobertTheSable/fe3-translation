Marth and the others once 
again moved out from Altea, 
and headed towards the 
imperial capital of Pales. [MapWaitForA]
But, along their way, they 
passed through the Kingdom of 
Gra, a land allied to Akaneia. [MapWaitForA]
In the previous war Gra sided 
with the Dolunian Empire, 
which resulted in their king, 
Jiol, dying in battle and the [MapWaitForA]
destruction of the kingdom. [MapWaitForA]
The country was once a part 
of Altea, but they sided with 
Akaneia after listening to 
Hardin's orders. [MapWaitForA]
Hardin found King Jiol's 
daughter, Princess Sheema, 
and allowed her to ascend the 
throne, and he then ordered [MapWaitForA]
reinforcements from Gra. [MapWaitForA]
Sheema received wild support 
from the citizens of Gra. [MapWaitForA]
To them, Sheema was their 
only hope. The youths all 
volunteered to become 
soldiers. [MapWaitForA]
They were happy to move out 
and have a chance to defeat 
their bitter enemy, Altea. [MapWaitForA]
But, their dreams were 
shattered in an instant... [MapWaitForA]
Before the fast approaching 
Altean elites, Gra's soldiers 
lost all morale, and fled for 
their lives. # length: 1018
