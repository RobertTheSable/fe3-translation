The Kingdom of Grust is a 
knights' country, which was 
founded by one of the three 
heroes of the liberation wars, [MapWaitForA]
General Ordwin. [MapWaitForA]
Since the country's formation, 
the neighbouring tribes were 
conquered by its mighty 
knights.  [MapWaitForA]
And finally it became one of 
the strongest of Akaneia's 
seven kingdoms. [MapWaitForA]
However, the current King, 
Ludwik, was weak. [MapWaitForA]
He feared the power of the 
resurrected Medeus, and so 
allied with Doluna. [MapWaitForA]
Also, following several 
consecutive defeats, he fell 
dangerously ill. [MapWaitForA]
The once brave and mighty 
Kingdom of Grust has finally 
entered the age of ruin. # length: 610
