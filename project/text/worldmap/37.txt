To avoid needless battle, the 
Altean army decided to cross 
the central mountain range, 
said to be impassable for a [MapWaitForA]
large army. [MapWaitForA]
Once they passed Adria Peak, 
they would be directly at 
Pales. [MapWaitForA]
Hurry, we can't let the enemy 
spot us! We must charge 
straight through!! [MapWaitForA]
Marth and the others were 
anxious, but they carried on 
advancing across the narrow 
mountain road. [MapWaitForA]
But they didn't expect, in the 
middle of the cliff, to be 
ambushed by an unfathomable 
enemy. [MapWaitForA]
They were the northern 
Kingdom of Aurelis's elite 
squad, [MapWaitForA]
the "Wolfsquad", who had 
headed south to aid Akaneia. # length: 612
