Carrying regretful feelings, 
Marth leaves Grust and lands 
at Medon, to rescue Princess 
Minerva. [MapWaitForA]
After the war of Darkness, 
Medon was ruled by Minerva, 
who removed the generals, 
who had caused suffering to [MapWaitForA]
her people, and renovated the 
army. [MapWaitForA]
However, the powerful General 
Rucke opposed Minerva's 
actions. [MapWaitForA]
He gathered the removed 
soldiers to overthrow her in a 
coup. [MapWaitForA]
The unprepared Minerva was 
captured by Rucke's followers 
and Medon fell into the control 
of the rebels. [MapWaitForA]
They then dispatched powerful 
dracoknights to sternly guard 
the country's bordering 
forests. # length: 610
