To obtain the Lightsphere, 
Marth headed towards Thabes 
Tower. [MapWaitForA]
Hidden under the sands is the 
ancient city of Thabes, as well 
as many buried treasures. [MapWaitForA]
The legends of this illusion 
city lured many men to the 
desert. [MapWaitForA]
However... Nobody was ever 
able to make it back. [MapWaitForA]
The sage once said... [MapWaitForA]
Don't go near the death desert 
of Marmotord, because at 
there lies a city cursed by 
darkness. # length: 411
