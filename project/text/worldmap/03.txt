The plains to the north east of 
Akaneia are ruled by the 
Kingdom of Aurelis. [MapWaitForA]
Since its formation, this 
northern kingdom has had a 
close relationship with the 
Holy Kingdom of Akaneia. [MapWaitForA]
Other countries have 
completely fallen, and one half 
of Aurelis has been conquered 
by Medon. [MapWaitForA]
However the King's younger 
brother, Hardin, nicknamed 
the "Coyote", continues 
fighting. [MapWaitForA]
It was also thanks to Duke 
Hardin that Akaneia's Princess 
Nyna was able to arrive 
safely. [MapWaitForA]
It has already been several 
months since letters were 
sent, containing plans to 
defeat the Dolunian Empire...[MapWaitForA]
But these sad cries for help
were left unanswered. [MapWaitForA]
Facing the Medonian army's 
elite forces, their fate is also 
reaching its end...# length: 748
