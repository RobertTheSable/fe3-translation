The many small kingdoms of 
this region were united, to 
become the Holy Kingdom of 
Akaneia, over 600 years ago. [MapWaitForA]
The founder, Adrah the First, 
obtained three weapons from 
the deities, and fought a holy 
war to unite the continent. [MapWaitForA]
From then on, the Kingdom of 
Akaneia became known as the 
Holy Kingdom protected by the 
deities, and the royal family [MapWaitForA]
were deeply respected. [MapWaitForA]
Recently six kingdoms became 
independent, which was also 
thanks to the help of Akaneia. [MapWaitForA]
Right now, Prince Marth makes 
his first steps into the grand 
holy capital of Pales. # length: 578
