Soon after reclaiming the Fane 
of Raman, Marth was pursed 
by Akaneia's army and headed 
towards Chiasmir Bridge to [MapWaitForA]
escape. [MapWaitForA]
However, after easily 
reaching the central islet, the 
Altean army was attacked by a 
new foe. [MapWaitForA]
"Akaneia's army is approaching 
from the north. If this 
continues we'll become 
surrounded." [MapWaitForA]
There's no way to go! 
Can Marth and the others 
safely overcome this danger? # length: 414
