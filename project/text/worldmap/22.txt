At one time, the Medonian
region was ruled by the
Dolunian Empire.[MapWaitForA]
100 years ago the whole 
continent was controlled by 
the dragon tribe, who sent 
numerous slaves to these [MapWaitForA]
undeveloped forests. [MapWaitForA]
The slaves were forced to 
excavate ruins and construct 
the country. [MapWaitForA]
Many people could not find 
food, were forced to work, and 
died from abuse. [MapWaitForA]
Amongst such tragic 
conditions, finally one youth 
stood up. His name was Iote.[MapWaitForA]
He and his companions 
escaped from the forests and 
fought, riding dragons, to 
continue the battle of [MapWaitForA]
liberation. [MapWaitForA]
After Doluna's fall, the slaves 
established their own country 
at these rich and newly 
developed lands. [MapWaitForA]
And the heroic Iote was 
encouraged to become its first 
king.[MapWaitForA]
Afterwards the Kingdom of 
Medon was feared as the land 
of dracoknights, and that was 
how it was born. [MapWaitForA]
However, this strong country 
not only lost its Prince 
Michalis, said to be the second 
coming of Iote.[MapWaitForA]
But now, even the "Crimson 
Dragoon", Princess Minerva, 
has been lost. # length: 1037
