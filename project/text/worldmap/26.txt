After liberating Grust, Marth 
accepted Wendell's request to 
find the lost Spheres, and 
headed to the Fane of Raman. [MapWaitForA]
However the ancient temple, 
built to worship Naga, was 
wrecked by constant warring 
and has now become a thieves' [MapWaitForA]
hideout. [MapWaitForA]
"They're escaping with the 
temple's valuable treasures. 
We mustn't let them take them 
away. We must recover them!!" [MapWaitForA]
"We mustn't attract the
attention of the soldiers 
guarding Chiasmir Bridge. [MapWaitForA]
We don't stand a chance of 
winning, so don't approach at 
all costs." [MapWaitForA]
"Also it seems there's a 
travelling child dancer who's 
lost her way in the forests. [MapWaitForA]
We must rescue her before she 
gets ambushed by the 
thieves!" [MapWaitForA]
After the troops received 
their orders, they surrounded 
The Fane of Raman. [MapWaitForA]
The flame of a new battle was 
about to ignite. # length: 825
