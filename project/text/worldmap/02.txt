Travelling from the frontier 
regions to Akaneia, Marth's 
biggest challenge has 
appeared. [MapWaitForA]
The Samsooth Peak is a steep 
mountain that divides the 
peninsula into northern and 
southern regions. [MapWaitForA]
Since some unknown time, 
bandits made it their base, and 
they started attacking 
nearby villages and travellers. [MapWaitForA]
Raids, kidnaps, setting fires... 
Their crimes are known to 
many. [MapWaitForA]
In fear, the people called the 
mountain "The Ghoul's Teeth". [MapWaitForA]
And they called those 
gathered at Samsooth the 
demonic "Soothsires"... # length: 539
