After much struggle, Marth 
finally escaped and arrived on 
Khadein soil. [MapWaitForA]
He then waited for the rest of 
his troops to catch up. [MapWaitForA]
The magic city, Khadein, is a 
sanctuary for mages. [MapWaitForA]
Many prospering mages go 
there to undergo vigorous 
training. [MapWaitForA]
The basis of Sorcery relies on 
sealing nature's hidden power 
into tomes and staves, and 
freely using those to harness [MapWaitForA]
great power. [MapWaitForA]
Hundreds of years ago, a sage 
created an academy here, and 
taught his life's teachings to 
people. [MapWaitForA]
However, originally designed 
to bring happiness to people, 
magic was used in conflicts, 
and was bought and sold in [MapWaitForA]
masses. [MapWaitForA]
The sage was disappointed, 
and disappeared without a 
trace. [MapWaitForA]
Although it seems hard to 
believe, some people say that 
sage was Archsage Gotoh. [MapWaitForA]
But right now, those who can 
wield tomes and staves are 
limited to a few high bishops. [MapWaitForA]
But even they can only use 
weak Fire and Heal magic. [MapWaitForA]
Powerful magic like Aura 
cannot be created without the 
power of Spheres. [MapWaitForA]
Also, those who can wield such 
powerful magic are limited in 
number. [MapWaitForA]
This was chosen to be by the 
will of its creator. [MapWaitForA]
