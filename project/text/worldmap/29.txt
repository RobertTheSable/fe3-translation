Khadein is a free city. It is not 
under the rule of any country, 
and is an independent country. [MapWaitForA]
Under the ruling Pontifex are 
numerous high bishops, and 
the city is run with their 
co-operation. [MapWaitForA]
However, because Pontifex 
Gharnef joined forces with 
Doluna, in the previous war, 
the city was dragged into [MapWaitForA]
conflict and destruction. [MapWaitForA]
After losing all the high 
bishops, Khadein was ruled by 
the newly elected Pontifex 
Wendell, who began the first [MapWaitForA]
steps along the road to 
reconstruction. [MapWaitForA]
But, Wendell, in order to 
complete his mission from 
Gotoh, left Khadein in the care 
of two youths. [MapWaitForA]
Merric and Elrean... They were 
both skilled youths, with high 
hopes placed on them. # length: 713
