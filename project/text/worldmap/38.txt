It is the 2nd month of the year 
3 of the imperial calendar... [MapWaitForA]
Akaneia's holy capital of Pales 
is currently in the middle of a 
mysterious silence. [MapWaitForA]
There was a rebellion in 
Akaneia, led by the paladin
Midia, which resulted in many
skilled knights being defeated [MapWaitForA]
and captured. [MapWaitForA]
Even so, Akaneia still had 
double Altea's army strength 
to arm the streets of Pales 
with. [MapWaitForA]
It has almost been a whole 
year since the Grustian
Expedition. [MapWaitForA]
Now, the last decisive battle, 
which will decide the fate of 
the two countries, is finally 
about to begin. # length: 573
