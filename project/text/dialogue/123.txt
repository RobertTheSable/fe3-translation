[ShowPortait][33][04]Marth, I am currently at a 
village north of Medon castle. [WaitForA]
That's right, it is already very 
close. [WaitForA]
If you have both the 
Starsphere and Lightsphere, 
please come and visit me. [WaitForA]
Without Starlight you will be 
unable to take back the 
Falchion from Gharnef. [WaitForA]
Gharnef has escaped to the 
illusion city of Thabes. [WaitForA]
Your sister, Elice, should also 
be there. [WaitForA]
I have been protecting her 
with my power, but I won't be 
able to hold out for much 
longer. [WaitForA]
Please hurry and rescue Elice. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
