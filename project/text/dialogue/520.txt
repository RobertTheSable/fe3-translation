[ShowPortait][02][07]Ha... He fled fast despite his 
big words. He should be pretty 
faraway by now.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][8b][04]Jagen... You really surprised 
me. I couldn't believe you 
would say something like that. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
You think I'm too old? Haha... 
Your highness, I won't lose to 
you youths just yet. [WaitForA]
That said. Even I, who 
persuaded your highness to 
stay calm, got into a dispute 
with Lang. [WaitForA]
I was too careless. 
What should we do next? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm. Well, we should go and 
find Ogma. If Lang was 
correct, he should have come 
to Medon. [WaitForA]
I bet he's probably heading for 
the village of Wendell's 
residence. [WaitForA]
Even though I'm worried about 
Minerva, there's nothing we 
can do right now. [WaitForA]
We should go and meet Wendell 
as well. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Understood. But, I wonder 
about Lang... I hope nothing 
bad will happen... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
