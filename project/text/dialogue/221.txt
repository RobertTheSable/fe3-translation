[ShowPortait][24][05]Oh, Lord Marth. I've been 
waiting for you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][8b][06]Boah!? You've suffered a 
grave wound... What 
happened? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... It was truly 
frightening... I suppose the 
Akaneian royal family is indeed 
under a curse. [WaitForA]
You should know about Hardin 
and Nyna's marriage, two 
years ago. [WaitForA]
To restore Akaneia, a king was 
required, and only two people 
were suitable. [WaitForA]
King Aurelis's younger 
brother, Hardin, and Altea's 
Prince Marth, you... [WaitForA]
Those were the choices, and 
we pleaded for Nyna to make 
the final decision. [WaitForA]
Originally, she wanted to wait 
a while longer, but we begged 
for her to make up her mind 
immediately. [WaitForA]
In the end she said that 
choosing Prince Marth as her 
husband would hurt Princess 
Shiida, [WaitForA]
so she finally decided on 
Hardin. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Wait a second, wasn't that a 
little harsh on Nyna? [WaitForA]
I understand that Akaneia 
needed a king, but Nyna, she 
already... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You are referring to Grust's 
Lord Camus? But that would be 
unspeakable... Unthinkable in 
fact. [WaitForA]
Princess Nyna was the sole 
successor of the royal 
bloodline of Akaneia. [WaitForA]
I felt bad as well, but for this 
country we had no other 
choice. However, Lord Hardin 
was very happy. [WaitForA]
Compared to ascending 
Akaneia's throne, he seemed 
happier about the fact that 
Nyna chose him for her [WaitForA]
husband. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I also understand Hardin's 
feelings. He could sacrifice his 
own life for Nyna. [WaitForA]
But, did he know about Camus? 
If he did, I don't believe he 
would be so happy. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Of course we kept that 
a secret, and we also 
persuaded Nyna to hide it as 
best as she could. [WaitForA]
But, Lord Hardin was a very 
sensitive man. He quickly 
found out that Nyna's heart 
had no place for him. [WaitForA]
He felt very painful... He 
locked himself in his room, and 
didn't allow anybody to see 
him. [WaitForA]
Taking advantage of his 
broken heart, Gharnef 
appeared. [WaitForA]
He took on the guise of a 
merchant to approach Hardin, 
and showed him the 
Darksphere. [WaitForA]
The distraught Hardin was 
quickly consumed by the 
Sphere. From that day on, he 
completely changed. [WaitForA]
It was because I was only 
focused on restoring this 
country that I committed such 
a horrendous mistake. [WaitForA]
Please, forgive me, Prince 
Marth... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I can't believe all that 
happened. [_17][ef][ff]..... [WaitForA]
[_16][10][00]Where is Nyna now? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
When Hardin discovered that 
she had taken the Emblem 
shield, he had her confined in 
her room. [WaitForA]
After that, she would still 
communicate in secret with me. 
However, Hardin found out and 
then he wounded me. [WaitForA]
He also handed Nyna over to 
Gharnef. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Gharnef...!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Gharnef had always 
wanted to take Nyna. [WaitForA]
He said that the resurrection 
of the shadow dragon required 
the blood of noble clerics... [WaitForA]
And so... He took Nyna... To 
use her as a live sacrifice... [WaitForA]
Lord Marth, I'm already done 
for. I will give my Thoron and 
Physic to you. [WaitForA]
I beg of you, please rescue 
Nyna. Even if Akaneia is 
destroyed it no longer 
matters... [WaitForA]
I only wish for Nyna to be 
safe... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
