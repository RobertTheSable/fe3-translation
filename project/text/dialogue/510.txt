[ShowPortait][33][04]Prince Marth. The altar is 
probably full of crazed 
barbarians and Mage Dragons 
that have lost their mind. [WaitForA]
They are being controlled by 
Gharnef's magic, and will 
definitely attack you. [WaitForA]
The dark priests that serve 
Gharnef also have fearful 
power. [WaitForA]
As this battle lengthens it will 
become fiercer, but don't stop 
and keep charging forwards! [WaitForA]
You must defeat Gharnef, and 
recover from him the divine 
Falchion sword that was stolen 
from Altea. [WaitForA]
Without the Falchion, you 
won't be able to defeat 
Medeus... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
