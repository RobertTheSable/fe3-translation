[ShowPortrait][8f][07]Marth!! I don't have to go back 
to the Ice Dragon Shrine 
anymore. [WaitForA]
I'm so happy! I really like 
everybody. I definitely don't 
want to live all by myself at 
that lonely place again. [WaitForA]
It's really... like a dream. I'm so 
happy, so very happy. Marth, I 
really like you!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
