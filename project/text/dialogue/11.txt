[ShowPortrait][65][04]Your highness, thank you very 
much for chasing off the 
pirates. [WaitForA]
Now we can finally live in 
peace once again. [WaitForA]
To reach Aurelis from here, 
you must cross the Ghoul's 
Teeth. [WaitForA]
Please be careful. 
The Ghoul's Teeth are ruled by 
the Soothsire gang of bandits. [WaitForA]
They have raided villages and 
ambushed travellers. [WaitForA]
They're a fearful bunch. [WaitForA]
Especially that bodyguard, 
Nabarl, who has a frightening 
sword arm. [WaitForA]
I sincerely hope that your 
journey is safe. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
