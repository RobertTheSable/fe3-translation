[ShowPortrait][61][07]Prince Marth... Thank you. 
Everything's finally over. [WaitForA]
Because of your efforts, this 
world was saved. [WaitForA]
But to you, the price to pay 
for this victory was too large. 
I am truly sorry. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][00][04]Nyna, please don't say that. 
Shiida's death was because of 
my own mistake. [WaitForA]
But... Shiida, for a while... 
Even to my death, I won't 
forget her. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Marth... Your love for her is... [WaitForA]
But, don't put the blame on 
yourself... [WaitForA]
Perhaps it is because we lost 
our loved ones that we were 
able to reach this promised 
victory. [WaitForA]
Although it is sorrowful, this 
is the eternal curse of the 
Fire Emblem. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
