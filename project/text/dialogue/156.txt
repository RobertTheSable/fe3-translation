[ShowPortrait][4c][04]Rucke, a coward like you 
wouldn't dare to do something 
this big. Did Hardin fool you 
with his fancy words? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7b][07]Ah! ...You are... How are you 
still...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You thought I was dead? 
Haha... Nevermind. [WaitForA]
Give Minerva back to me. I 
don't care about this country 
anymore. [WaitForA]
You can do what you want with 
it. However, I won't rest until I 
have dealt with "that guy" 
personally. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes... But... Princess Minerva 
has already breathed her 
last... She cannot be saved... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Don't waste my time. Hand her 
over now, or do you prefer to 
die by my lance? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
O-okay! I understand. Hey, 
you, bring the princess here! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
