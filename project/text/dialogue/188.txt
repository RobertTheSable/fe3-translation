[ShowPortait][8b][05]Jagen, this place is...[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][02][06]This is the death desert of 
Marmotord.[WaitForA]
There was a story about it in 
the Anri Saga. [WaitForA]
[SetColor][00][2c]Preventing my path, first was 
the desert of death.
With its scorching sun and 
blazing sandstorms. [WaitForA]
Barbarians of the Sand  
Clan and soaring dragons 
roam.  [WaitForA]
The illusion town was within 
sight, but I could only remain 
where I was standing.[SetColor][00][24]
...[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? So Anri once came 
here, and all alone as well... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That's right. King Anri began 
his travels here, to obtain the 
divine sword, Falchion. [WaitForA]
And that was so that he could 
rescue Princess Artemis... [WaitForA]
Although it will be long, I would 
like to describe the legend of 
Anri. [WaitForA][_89][48][80][_10][01]
100 years ago... The ruler of 
this continent, the Holy 
Kingdom of Akaneia, was 
destroyed by the dragon tribe. [WaitForA]
Humans were enslaved and 
lived each day in despair. [WaitForA]
Some people wielded weapons 
to fight back, but they 
couldn't defeat the dragon 
tribe, and many people died. [WaitForA]
Also, the humans' only hope, 
the Akaneia royal family, was 
wiped out, and so the world 
lost all hope. [WaitForA]
However, at that time, at a 
small city called Altea. It was 
discovered that the princess 
of Akaneia was hiding there. [WaitForA]
The angered Dolunian Empire 
sent soldiers to Altea, aiming
to capture the princess.[WaitForA]
That princess... Artemis was 
prepared to give up her own 
life to save the citizens. [WaitForA]
However the citizens of Altea 
swore that, even if they were 
completely annihilated, they 
would protect the princess. [WaitForA]
Knowing that the princess was 
still alive, the citizens of 
Pales gathered a liberation 
army, and continued the fight [WaitForA]
against the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
The leader of the liberation 
army, Duke Cartas, fought 
with the royal shield, given to 
him by Artemis.[WaitForA]
As a result, he received 
enormous support. [WaitForA]
Thanks to his efforts, the war 
finally began to become in 
their favour. [WaitForA]
But then, the King of the Earth
Dragons, Medeus, finally 
moved out.  [WaitForA]
The dark breath of Earth 
Dragons possessed 
horrendous destructive power 
and had the effect of halving 
the enemy's strength. [WaitForA]
Under such a dire situation it 
was thought that Altea's 
resistance wasn't going to 
hold out. [WaitForA]
Then, at that time, a Sage 
appeared and told the people 
that at the Ice Dragon 
Shrine, to the distant north, [WaitForA]
was a sword blessed by the 
deities. [WaitForA]
With that sword, the Earth 
Dragons could be defeated, 
but it definitely wasn't an 
easy task to reach the [WaitForA]
temple... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
So Anri, to save his beloved 
Artemis, left on a journey to 
obtain the sword? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, that's right. But I think 
that's enough for today. We 
still have a long road ahead of 
us... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
