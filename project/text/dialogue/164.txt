[ShowPortait][74][07]Captain Jeorge. The 
commander ordered us to 
return to the castle 
immediately. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][20][04]Lang...? I hate that guy. He 
treats the civilians like 
slaves. [WaitForA]
I'm not seriously going to work 
for a guy like him. Just ignore 
his order. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
But, Captain Jeorge. If we do 
that, you will become a 
criminal. [WaitForA]
Captain!? Are you thinking of 
siding with Altea...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No, I couldn't do that... If I did 
that right now, my men would 
get into trouble. [WaitForA]
That's something that I must 
avoid at all costs. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Captain Jeorge... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Alright, just tell everyone 
this. Tell them to stay where 
they are. [WaitForA]
However if the enemy gets 
close, begin to attack. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
