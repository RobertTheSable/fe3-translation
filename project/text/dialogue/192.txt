[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Xane, we've already climbed 
this high. It's so cold... Even 
breathing is hard. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][28][07]We're almost there. Look, can 
you see over there? That's 
the Ice Dragon Shrine where 
Gotoh is.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
But, that was quite a shock. 
Tiki is actually the daughter 
of the Divine Dragon King. [WaitForA]
Also, both Gotoh and you are 
Divine Dragons. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ah... When the Divine Dragons 
fought the Earth Dragons they 
over-exhausted their 
dragonstones, and so [WaitForA]
practically became extinct. [WaitForA]
Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, 
me and the just born Tiki 
survived. [WaitForA]
However, after the war we 
discarded our dragonstones, 
so we could no longer become 
dragons again. [WaitForA]
Even so, I still have knowledge 
and power that exceeds that 
of humans. [WaitForA]
Gotoh followed Naga's orders 
to protect humans, but that's 
got nothing to do with me. I 
don't like humans. [WaitForA]
They scorned the Manaketes, 
even though they had lost 
their power, and treated them 
like filth. [WaitForA]
I can fully understand why 
Medeus and the others hated 
humans so much. [WaitForA]
The Earth Dragon King, 
Medeus, tricked his own tribe 
and became a Manakete by 
himself. [WaitForA]
He used to follow Naga's 
orders and guarded the 
Dragon's Table. [WaitForA]
However the once docile 
humans finally achieved power 
and became aggressive. [WaitForA]
They even started to attack 
the Manaketes that lived in 
peace. [WaitForA]
The Manaketes were angered 
by the betrayal of humans, and 
gathered at the Doluna region. [WaitForA]
They formed their own kingdom 
of Manaketes and began a war 
to conquer the humans. [WaitForA]
To save humans, Gotoh 
handed the Falchion to Anri 
and he created an academy 
of magic at Khadein. [WaitForA]
But whoever won wasn't any of 
my concern. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Then, why are you helping me? 
I'm also a human... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
You're different from the 
others. You don't seem like an 
unreliable person either... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Thank you, Xane. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Don't... don't be silly. I'll get 
embarrassed. Anyway, let's 
head to the temple, but be 
careful of the Ice Dragons. [WaitForA]
Although they're also wild 
dragons, they will 
instinctively try to protect 
their temple. Poor guys... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
