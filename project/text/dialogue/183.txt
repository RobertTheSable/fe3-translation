[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Huh!? Princess Minerva, what 
are you doing here? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][92][04]My brother... Michalis rescued 
me. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Really? That's great. When I 
heard that you were taken by 
Pince Michalis, I was very 
worried. [WaitForA]
But he actually saved you. I 
wonder what he's thinking. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Michalis's life was saved by 
Maria. Maria is a gentle child, 
unlike me... [WaitForA]
Even a man like him could be 
moved by Maria's gentle heart. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
But, you also hoped for that, 
and that's why you didn't 
finish him off, right?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh.
[_17][ef][ff]..... [WaitForA]
[_16][10][00][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I understand. The bond 
between siblings cannot be 
torn so easily. [WaitForA]
Princess Minerva, please look 
up. You don't need to worry 
about Medon. [WaitForA]
I already left some trusted 
people to begin its 
reconstruction. [WaitForA]
I hope that you can fight 
together with us, like in the 
past. [WaitForA]
To crush Hardin's ambitions, I 
wish to borrow Medon's and 
your strength. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
