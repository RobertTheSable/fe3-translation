[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Jagen, everybody appears to 
be safe. That's great to see. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]But, your highness, what 
should we do next? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmmm... I want to return to 
Altea, but if we don't defeat 
Hardin we won't be able to 
save it. [WaitForA]
What on earth should we do...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Please wait a second. I just 
received some news. [WaitForA]
[_17][ef][ff]..... 
[_16][10][00]What!? Your highness, there's 
trouble. Khadein's mage army 
has launched an attack at us. [WaitForA]
It seems Khadein has allied 
with the Empire. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh!? Even Khadein views us 
as enemies? What is Merric 
doing...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness, we've got to do 
something. [WaitForA]
Even though we'll probably 
have to make some sacrifices, 
we should charge straight for 
the temple.[WaitForA]
If we don't hurry up, Akaneia's 
pursuit squad will appear from 
behind and prevent us from 
moving. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I understand. There's no 
choice. [WaitForA]
Troops, charge into Khadein 
Temple, but try to avoid 
needless battles if possible! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
