[ShowPortrait][87][04]Merric... Our match is due. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8e][07]Wait, Elrean! Why must we 
fight? We both studied under 
Master Wendell. Why do you 
hate me so much? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I became Master's student 
before you, and I was stronger 
than you. [WaitForA]
Yet he gave Excalibur, which 
should have been mine, to you. [WaitForA]
Why, Merric? Is it because 
you're a noble of Altea? I was 
so angry. [WaitForA]
I believed I was going to be 
Master's successor... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Is that it...? I'm sorry, Elrean, I
will apologise to you.  [WaitForA]
However, I never once thought
about succeeding Master.  [WaitForA]
I don't hate Khadein, but I had 
already decided to return to 
my homeland upon finishing my 
studies. [WaitForA]
At Altea there is somebody 
that I wish to protect for my 
whole life... [WaitForA]
So, that's why Master 
Wendell's successor can only 
be you. [WaitForA]
Elrean, please! To reclaim 
Altea, will you lend me your
strength?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Altea!? The country that 
betrayed the Akaneia Empire 
and, so, was invaded by them? [WaitForA]
Why should I help them? Our 
mage army has already sworn 
loyalty to Emperor Hardin. [WaitForA]
Right... So it was you... It was 
you who brought the Altean 
army here! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No!! It's all a 
misunderstanding! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Shut up, you traitor!! I'm not 
going to listen to your lies 
anymore! [WaitForA]
Will your Excalibur prevail, or 
will it be my Thoron? Come! Let 
us find out! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
