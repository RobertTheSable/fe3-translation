[ShowPortait][02][06]Your highness, we've finally 
subdued Grust. [WaitForA]
However, many enemies are 
hiding inside the castle. So we 
must be careful. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][90][05]Hmm, I understand. [WaitForA]
Still... If we don't defeat Lang, 
the citizens of this country 
cannot be saved. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That's right. He must be 
defeated at all costs... [WaitForA]
Yet, we don't know what 
dastardly plans he has 
prepared for us. [WaitForA]
So, if we're fighting inside, we 
must be extremely careful! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
