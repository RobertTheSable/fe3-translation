[ShowPortrait][28][07]Phew. We've finally passed the 
Fire Dragons' valley. Are you 
okay, Marth? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Uh... Yeah, I'm fine. Xane, 
you said that there were other 
wild dragons elsewhere. Is that
true?  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, the majority of the 
dragon tribe didn't listen to 
the elders' advice, and were 
lost... [WaitForA]
Those that survived didn't 
really stay at a single place. [WaitForA]
Aside from the Fire Dragons' 
valley there is also the 
Wyvern Valley, the Ice 
Dragon Shrine and the [WaitForA]
Dragon's Table... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Dragon's Altar...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, behind the mountains of 
Medon is a graveyard of Mage 
Dragons. That is also where 
the Earth Dragons sleep. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Earth Dragons...!? There are 
other Earth Dragons besides 
Medeus!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Of course. Amongst the dragon 
tribe they are closest in 
strength to the Divine 
Dragons, and possess [WaitForA]
tremendous power. [WaitForA]
They didn't agree with the 
elders and left to form their 
own group. [WaitForA]
They currently reside at the 
Doluna region, but... their fate 
didn't change. [WaitForA]
Eventually the Earth Dragons 
all lost their minds and, 
together with the Mage 
Dragons and Flying Dragons [WaitForA]
who had also degenerated, 
started to attack humans. [WaitForA]
Of course, humans could not 
hope to stand up to them. [WaitForA]
Humans almost became extinct 
and, in the end, were forced to 
a single corner of the 
continent. [WaitForA]
Then, at that time... [WaitForA]
Naga, the king of the Divine 
Dragons, the strongest of all 
dragons, commanded his tribe 
to begin a battle to protect [WaitForA]
the humans. [WaitForA]
It was a difficult battle, but in 
the end Naga was victorious. [WaitForA]
He sealed the Earth Dragons 
underneath Doluna and sent 
them to a deep sleep. [WaitForA]
To prevent the seal's
strength from weakening, he
created the "[SetColor][00][28]Shield of the five 
Spheres" [SetColor][00][24]and left it at the[WaitForA]
Fane of Raman.[WaitForA]
But that is already ancient 
history... In fact it occured 
over 1000 years ago. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? I finally understand. [WaitForA]
The Guardian God, Naga, of 
legends was actually the king 
of the Divine Dragons, Naga, 
who helped mankind. [WaitForA]
Those events became legends 
that have been passed on 
even now. [WaitForA]
But if that was the case, why 
was the divine sword, Falchion 
left behind for humans? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, that is a dragon buster. 
A sword designed to defeat 
dragons. [WaitForA]
Naga felt pity for the humans 
that could not protect 
themselves so he crafted it 
from his own fang. [WaitForA]
The sword was sealed within 
the Fane of Raman, along with 
the shield. [WaitForA]
And a powerful spell was cast 
on the temple, so that only 
Divine Dragons could enter it. [WaitForA]
After that, Naga left behind a 
will to his own people, which 
was to protect mankind. [WaitForA]
Finally, he placed the newly 
born Tiki into a deep sleep, 
thus ending the remaining 
5000 years of his life. [WaitForA]
So, you can see why Gotoh is 
still faithfully follow his 
orders. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh, Xane...? Could it be!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, Gotoh is a Divine Dragon. 
What, you thought there was 
just me...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Wa-wait, Xane. I still don't 
understand. What exactly did 
you mean? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Phew, my throat is really dry. I 
can't stand the heat anymore. 
Marth, let's hurry along. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[CloseFrame][03]
