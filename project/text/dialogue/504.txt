[ShowPortrait][67][04]I heard General Lorenz resided 
at Talys island in his youth. [WaitForA]
At that time, Talys was not 
unified, and there were 
conflicts between the island 
tribes. [WaitForA]
The general helped a youthful 
chief to unite the island.[WaitForA]
From that day on, the general 
and the chief, now the current 
King Talys, have always been 
in contact. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
