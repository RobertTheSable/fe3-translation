[ShowPortrait][33][04]Marth, this is the Starsphere. 
You can take this with you as 
well. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Huh? Gotoh, why are you 
giving such an important item 
to me? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The only person that can 
restore the Binding Shield is 
you... The Shield, itself, has 
chosen you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
[_17][ef][ff].....? [WaitForA]
[_16][10][00][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You still don't understand? 
The Emblem shield you're 
carrying is the stolen [SetColor][00][28]Binding 
Shield. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA]
To be honest, it was only 
recently that I noticed; its 
exterior had completely 
changed... [WaitForA]
After stealing it from the Fane 
of Raman, the thief removed 
its jewels and sold them off as 
treasures. [WaitForA]
The money was used to fund an 
army, which, along with three 
stolen weapons, was used to 
conquer the world. [WaitForA]
The thief that went on to 
become the king of Akaneia 
had the shield, which brought 
him such good fortune, become [WaitForA]
the emblem of his royal family. [WaitForA]
Now do you understand, 
Marth? It is what you are 
carrying, Akaneia's [SetColor][00][28]Fire 
Emblem. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
!! What... ...The first king of 
Akaneia was originally a 
thief!? [WaitForA]
Is that true...? In that case, I 
can kind of understand the 
curse of the Fire Emblem... [WaitForA]
Then, Gotoh... If I can collect 
all five Spheres, can I restore 
the Binding Shield? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... But please hurry up. 
The shield has already been 
broken for 600 years... [WaitForA]
It is almost time for the Earth 
Dragons, sealed underneath 
Medon, to awaken from their 
slumber. [WaitForA]
Those evil Earth Dragons 
number several hundreds... No, 
several thousands. [WaitForA]
Once they awaken there will be 
nothing that we can do... [WaitForA]
I will leave Tiki in your care.[WaitForA]
You can find her in the room to
the right. That Divine Dragon 
child should be able to help 
you battle the Earth Dragons. [WaitForA]
But, I will state clearly, if the 
Binding Shield is not restored, 
Tiki will be destroyed. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh...!? Why is that... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
That child is still developing. 
Without the Binding Shield she 
will begin to degenerate. [WaitForA]
Eventually she will become wild 
and attack humans. I made her 
sleep, because I felt sad for 
her. [WaitForA]
But, if the Binding Shield is 
restored I will no longer have 
to worry, because the shield 
will protect Tiki. [WaitForA]
Marth, please take care of 
Tiki. You must rescue that 
child from the path of ruin. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
