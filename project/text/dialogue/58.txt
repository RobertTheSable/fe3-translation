[ShowPortrait][61][07]Prince Marth, do you know 
about Akaneia's Archbishop 
Miloah? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][00][04]Yes. The great bishop who 
protected Akaneia with his 
Aura tome... [WaitForA]
He died in battle against 
Doluna's ally, the Dark 
Pontifex Gharnef. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, well, the bishop had a 
daughter called Linde. That 
child inherited his Aura tome. [WaitForA]
However, after Miloah died, 
Linde disappeared and her 
whereabouts are unknown. [WaitForA]
I heard she was sold to the 
slave market... She must be 
very sad right now. [WaitForA]
...Marth, I beg of you! Please 
find Linde for me. [WaitForA]
And protect her, in place of 
the deceased bishop Miloah. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
