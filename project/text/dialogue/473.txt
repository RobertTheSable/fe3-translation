[ShowPortait][80][06]Really, Tiki... For how long do 
you plan on hogging Marth!? [WaitForA]
Honestly Marth, if you dare to 
show even the slightest 
happiness, Shiida won't 
forgive you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][8c][05]Malicia, you're talking 
nonsense again. However 
Marth really does look happy... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
He can finally put to rest his 
heavy burden. Lord Marth has 
always been carrying such a 
heavy responsibility. [WaitForA]
It must have been hard on him. 
But Shiida has also had it 
hard. [WaitForA]
There are so many people 
around Marth that finding a 
chance to even talk to him is 
difficult. [WaitForA]
You must have been lonely. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... It doesn't matter. As 
long as Marth is safe, I 
wouldn't wish for anything 
else. [WaitForA]
I once prayed to the deities, 
since Marth had such an 
important mission. [WaitForA]
I prayed that if they decided 
his life was to be taken, to 
take my life in his place... [WaitForA]
That was all I could do. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
[_17][ef][ff]..... [_16][10][01]Ah, Shiida truly can't be
beaten. But, you don't have to 
wait any longer. [WaitForA]
Because Lord Marth is about 
to return to your side. Look, 
Shiida, Marth is looking over 
there. [WaitForA]
Use your courage! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
