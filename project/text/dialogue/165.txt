[ShowPortait][6f][05]Oh... Please spare this girl. 
She is just 10 years old. [WaitForA]
She hasn't even finished her 
training as a cleric. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][8b][07]Don't worry, old lady. We're 
not going to take this child. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh...? Aren't you a soldier of 
the Empire? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No... You've got the wrong 
idea. We haven't come here to 
fight. [WaitForA]
If you require anything, please 
ask. [WaitForA]
We have some food, please 
take it if you want. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[_89][4c][80][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][80][04]Wait... Please, take me with 
you... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
You... You're REALLY only 10 
years old? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Actually I have already become 
of age...  [WaitForA]
But, my grandmother lied for 
me so the soldiers wouldn't 
take me away. [WaitForA]
Well, I know if I stay here I will 
eventually be discovered and 
captured by the imperial 
soldiers. [WaitForA]
Lang's soldiers are like 
beasts. But, you're different. 
You have very kind eyes. [WaitForA]
Please, take me out of this 
country and to your own 
country. Is that alright, 
grandmother? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][6f][05]Ah, of course. You will be much 
safer compared to here.  [WaitForA]
Young lad, I beg of you. Please 
protect this girl. [WaitForA]
If you want, it would be no 
problem for her to become 
your bride. [WaitForA]
This child, like me in the past, 
is a beautiful girl. She will 
definitely make a fine wife. [WaitForA]
Malicia, if this youth was to be 
your husband, you would be 
happy, right? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][80][04]Honestly, grandmother. It's 
far too early. Malicia doesn't 
know what to do. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[CloseFrame][03]
