[ShowPortrait][81][05]Commander Lang. A... Altea's 
army has come... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][83][06]Fool, get a grip. Their army 
doesn't amount to anything. 
They can't possibly defeat us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
But Lord Jeorge's archers left 
to quell the rebellion. Can we 
win just by ourselves? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What did you say!? Call Jeorge 
back this instant. [WaitForA]
While you're there, call that 
mercenary, Nabarl, here. [WaitForA]
Anyway, I'll leave this to you, 
General Toras. I must leave to 
prepare the defences inside. [WaitForA]
You will stay here and guard to 
the death. You mustn't let 
them get close. Understood? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
