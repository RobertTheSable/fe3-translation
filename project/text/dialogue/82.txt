[ShowPortrait][2f][04]Lord Marth, greetings. I am 
Palla of the Whitewings. [WaitForA]
After hearing that you 
rescued Maria, my sister, 
Catria, and I escaped from 
Medon. [WaitForA]
Following my promise to Catria, 
I will also fight together with 
Minerva. [WaitForA]
However, our youngest sister, 
Est, headed to Grust and 
hasn't been seen since. [WaitForA]
Once she returns, we three 
will be able to help you out 
even more... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
