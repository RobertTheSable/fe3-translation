[ShowPortrait][02][06]Prince Marth. [WaitForA]
The enemies in the castle have 
been vanquished. Altea is 
finally in our hands again. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][05]Really? That's great. But, I 
still don't see my sister... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[PlaySong][43][80][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][33][06]Your highness, Princess Elice 
was taken by Gharnef. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? Gotoh, is that true!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
He ordered the dark priests to 
search for the clerics of noble 
birth. [WaitForA]
Lena, Maria... and even your 
sister Elice. They have all 
been taken by Gharnef... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Is that so... But what is he 
planning on doing by capturing 
them? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That I don't know, but I bet it's
not anything good. The chain 
of events so far was all the 
doing of Gharnef.  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Gotoh! Where is he now? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I don't know, but I bet 
Gharnef's next target will be 
Princess Nyna. So he is 
probably at Pales... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I see. We will go to Pales. I will 
rescue Hardin from the 
Darksphere's influence. [WaitForA]
I will defeat Gharnef and the 
dark priests... And I will rescue 
the captured clerics!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
