[ShowPortrait][60][04]Prince Marth, we can finally 
talk about the Manaketes. [WaitForA]
The Manaketes already 
existed on this continent long 
before humans, and were 
referred to as the dragon 
tribe. [WaitForA]
However, they were punished 
by the deities, and were 
forced to seal their true form 
in stones and, afterwards, [WaitForA]
lived anonymously in the 
frontier lands... [WaitForA]
They coexisted with humans, 
living a life of peace and 
without conflict. [WaitForA]
However, 100 years ago, at 
the Doluna Region the Shadow 
Dragon [SetColor][00][2c]Medeus [SetColor][00][24] appeared. [WaitForA]
He gathered all the Manaketes 
that hated humans, and formed 
the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
He then led an attack on the 
human world, and soon they 
had conquered the whole 
continent.[WaitForA]
Of course, humans fought 
back to the death. But in front 
of Medeus's might, it was no 
use. [WaitForA]
Then, at that time, a youth 
from Altea, wielding the [SetColor][00][28]
Falchion[SetColor][00][24], a sword that 
radiated light, appeared in [WaitForA]
front of Medeus. [WaitForA]
After an intense battle, he 
defeated Medeus. [WaitForA]
That's right. Your highness 
should know what happened 
afterwards. [WaitForA]
That youth, who founded the 
Kingdom of Altea, was [SetColor][00][2c]Anri the 
First. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA]
But, 100 years after that 
dark age... At Doluna, Medeus 
awakened once again. [WaitForA]
Prince Marth! You are the only 
one with Anri's blood, the 
chosen one. [WaitForA]
You are the only one that can 
succeed the will of your 
deceased father, King 
Cornelius. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
