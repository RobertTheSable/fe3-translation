[ShowPortait][61][04]Prince Marth. [WaitForA]
About Grust, there is
something that I wish to tell 
you. [WaitForA]
You should know that Grust's 
famous Sable Order are led by 
General Camus. [WaitForA]
3 years ago, Akaneia was 
occupied by his men. I was also 
captured by him. [WaitForA]
Doluna wanted the entire 
Akaneia royal family to be
killed, and they prepared to 
kill the sole survivor, me. [WaitForA]
But Camus didn't fear Doluna's 
Shadow Dragon, Medeus, and 
he constantly protected the 
young me. [WaitForA]
Once he discovered that 
Medeus had sent his personal 
guards, he had me escape to 
Aurelis. [WaitForA]
Afterwards, he was only held 
captive until recently, 
because he had won many 
victories for Doluna. [WaitForA]
At first I really hated him... 
But now, no matter what, I 
cannot find it in myself to do 
so... [WaitForA]
If possible, I don't want to 
fight against him. [WaitForA]
....I just want to see him one 
more time... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][00]
