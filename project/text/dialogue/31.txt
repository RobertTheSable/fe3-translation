[_88][00][PlaySong][20][80][ShowPortrait][6b][04]Kid, what are you looking at? 
You haven't seen many rural 
towns like this? [WaitForA]
Now that you mention it, I 
remember the time I went to 
Pyrathi. [WaitForA]
I was really shocked when I 
first saw a Manakete... [WaitForA]
An ordinary looking old man 
suddenly transformed into a 
gigantic dragon. [WaitForA]
That was really... surprising. [WaitForA]
Well... I knew that the dragon 
tribe had some survivors. 
But I didn't expect them to be 
so impressive. [WaitForA]
Huh...? Oh... This? I found it 
there. [WaitForA]
I don't know what it is, but you 
don't see many glowing red 
stones like this, right? [WaitForA]
Oh well. It doesn't seem normal 
to me. If you want, you can 
have it. [WaitForA]
See you, kid. I hope we can 
meet again. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
