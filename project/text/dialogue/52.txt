[ShowPortait][1c][04]Prince Marth, I am Catria of 
Medon's Whitewings. [WaitForA]
I've actually arrived in secret 
to request for help from your 
highness. [WaitForA]
Our Princess Minerva is 
preparing to rebel against the 
Dolunian Empire. [WaitForA]
But because her younger 
sister, Maria, is still in 
Doluna's grasp, she has been 
unable to act. [WaitForA]
Please, rescue Princess Maria. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
