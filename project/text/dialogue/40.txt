[ShowPortait][11][07]Ah... Master! It's you, Master 
Wendell. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][29][04]Oh! Is it Merric? You're looking 
lively. It's good to see you're 
well.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes. I finally caught up with 
Altea's Prince Marth. [WaitForA]
I am currently with the 
liberation army, fighting 
against the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
But, Master, why are you
here...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Sigh... Khadein is finished. [WaitForA]
Khadein is currently ruled by 
the Dark Pontifex, Gharnef, 
and has become a city of 
darkness. [WaitForA]
But I couldn't agree to do his 
evil deeds, so I escaped. Along 
the way I was captured by the 
Medonian soldiers at Aurelis. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Is that so... Then, Master, can 
you please aid us? [WaitForA]
We're no match for Gharnef 
and the Dolunian Empire... Yet,[WaitForA]
We must reclaim Khadein in the
end. [WaitForA]
Prince Marth would be very 
happy if a great bishop, like 
you, joined our cause. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Is that so? Although I 
don't like fighting, I guess this 
is the only option... [WaitForA]
I understand, Merric. I will 
fight together with you. 
Please inform Prince Marth 
about this action. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
