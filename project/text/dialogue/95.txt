[ShowPortait][00][04]Soldiers of Altea, and the 
warriors that have fought 
alongside us, I am truly 
grateful to you all. [WaitForA]
Thanks to your efforts, we
have finally reclaimed our 
homeland of Altea from the 
hands of Doluna. [WaitForA]
But there are probably many 
enemies waiting for us inside 
the castle. [WaitForA]
Everybody, don't be careless! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
