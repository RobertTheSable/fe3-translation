[ShowPortait][33][04]Prince Marth... I am Archsage 
Gotoh. [WaitForA]
I am currently using my magic 
to communicate with you. [WaitForA]
... It is saddening to see you 
being mocked by Gharnef... 
Listen to me well. [WaitForA]
Gharnef and Miloah were both 
my pupils. But Gharnef stole 
Imhullu from me and 
disappeared. [WaitForA]
Mmm... He indeed has the 
Falchion as well. [WaitForA]
With Imhullu and the Falchion, 
the Dolunian Empire has 
nothing to fear.[WaitForA]
This world will eventually be 
theirs.[WaitForA]
So long as Gharnef has 
Imhullu, you won't be able to 
defeat him. [WaitForA]
...However... There is one
method.[WaitForA]
Find the [SetColor][00][28]Starsphere [SetColor][00][24]and [SetColor][00][28]
Lightsphere [SetColor][00][24]and bring them to 
me. [WaitForA]
With them both, then the only 
magic tome that can penetrate 
Imhullu, [SetColor][00][28]Starlight [SetColor][00][24]can be... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
