[ShowPortait][01][07]General Lorenz, I am Shiida of 
Talys. [WaitForA]
I have heard much about you 
from my father. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][31][04]Ah, Princess Shiida. [WaitForA]
You have become more 
beautiful now. [WaitForA]
I really must thank your 
father, for his care in the 
past. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
General, you're opposed to 
Grust allying with the Dolunian 
Empire, right?[WaitForA]
Why didn't you stop them?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The current King of Grust is a 
weak and cowardly man. [WaitForA]
He feared Doluna's enormous 
strength. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
General. Doluna wishes to use 
Manaketes to conquer humans. [WaitForA]
For Grust, and for the 
innocent people of this world, 
we must stop Doluna's 
ambitions. [WaitForA]
General, please stop fighting, 
and please help us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Uh... But... [WaitForA]
Well... I was ordered by my king 
to fight, but times have 
changed. [WaitForA]
I understand, Princess Shiida. [WaitForA]
Even though betraying my 
country is wrong, I will still 
join your cause. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
