[ShowPortrait][8b][04]...Jagen, what's going on? Why 
has Hardin handed over this 
country to such a man...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]General Lang was once a noble 
of Akaneia. However, in the 
previous war, he supported 
the Dolunian Empire. [WaitForA]
I heard that he stole from 
other people, to add to his own 
wealth. [WaitForA]
I fear he has continued his 
ways at Grust, and caused 
suffering to its people. [WaitForA]
So General Lorenz's rebellion 
is completely understandable. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Jagen! How can you say things 
so casually? [WaitForA]
If we don't inform Hardin of 
the truth, more innocent 
people will be killed. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness, I understand 
your feelings. However, 
Lorenz's rebellion is a fact. [WaitForA]
First, we must see how we can 
help him. [WaitForA]
Basically, we should listen to 
what the citizens have to say, 
so we can affirm what has 
happened to this country. [WaitForA]
Then your highness can talk to 
General Lorenz personally. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
But the rebels don't know that 
we're from Altea. Can we reach 
the fortress safely? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Don't worry. Most of the 
rebels have already fled. All 
that remains is Lorenz, and 
the children in the fortress. [WaitForA]
Blocking our path are only 
bandits, who have taken 
advantage of the confusion to 
raid villages. [WaitForA]
They are no problem for us. 
You can order Arran to defeat 
them in one blow if you want. [WaitForA]
However, your highness, we 
have some fresh recruits in 
our army that could use some 
fighting experience. [WaitForA]
To them, bandits are 
relatively strong foes. So be 
careful not to push them too 
much. [WaitForA]
If possible, I would have liked 
to fight as well, but my body is 
not what it used to be. [WaitForA]
I will stay by your highness's 
side, as your tactician. [WaitForA]
Well, your highness, we should 
go! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
