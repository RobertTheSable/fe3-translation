[ShowPortrait][33][04]Marth, you still haven't 
brought with you the 
Starsphere and Lightsphere? [WaitForA]
It is unfortunate, but I cannot 
create Starlight. [WaitForA]
You must give up all thoughts 
of defeating Gharnef. [WaitForA]
Without recovering the 
Falchion from him, the battle 
against Medeus will be very 
difficult. [WaitForA]
But if you're still determined, 
then you must gain more 
experience, until you have 
reached the limits of your [WaitForA]
body's power. [WaitForA]
Then you must arm yourself 
with mighty weapons such as 
the Mercurius Sword, Gradivus 
or Parthia. [WaitForA]
That way, defeating Medeus 
may not be completely 
impossible. [WaitForA]
.....But, Marth..... [WaitForA]
This road will be very difficult. 
Are you prepared...? [WaitForA]
Think carefully about 
everything, before making 
your decision to advance. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
