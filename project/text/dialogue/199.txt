[ShowPortait][74][06]General, the missing Altean 
remnants have finally 
returned. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][88][05]Really? Haha...! What good 
timing. [WaitForA]
We will follow our original plan. 
Have Gra's soldiers move out 
to lure them and then defeat 
them in one go. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Understood, but, what about 
"him"? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The paladin, Abel? It doesn't 
matter if he betrays me! If he 
does, you will kill the female 
hostage!![WaitForA]
He has already retired from 
the army. He won't swear 
loyalty to the prince again. [WaitForA]
Ha ha...! How will they avoid 
fighting Abel...? This will be 
very interesting to watch... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
