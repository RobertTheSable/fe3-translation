[ShowPortait][32][04]Marth... I've missed you so 
much. [WaitForA]
Look at how you've grown... 
Father must be very happy... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[ShowPortait][00][05]Sister!! After discovering that 
you had been taken by 
Gharnef, I was extremely 
worried. [WaitForA]
I'm glad you're safe... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[ShowPortait][32][04]Gharnef captured me so that 
he could obtain the 
resurrection staff, Aum, from 
Gotoh. [WaitForA]
If this staff is used at the 
temple south from Doluna, it 
can allow any person to come 
back to life. [WaitForA]
Let's go, Marth... To bring 
back the most important 
people that you lost. [WaitForA]
Let's go!! To Doluna! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
