[ShowPortait][25][04]I am Arran. I used to work as 
the captain of a knights group. [WaitForA]
However, for certain reasons, 
I now reside here. [WaitForA]
I am very happy to be able to 
serve you. [WaitForA]
But this village and its 
neighbourigng village haven't 
got on well for a long time. [WaitForA]
Once they know that your 
highness has visited this 
village, they will close their 
village's gate. [WaitForA]
You should give up thinking of 
trying to recruit Samson. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
