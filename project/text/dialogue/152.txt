[ShowPortrait][02][07]Your highness, we found an 
unexpected person held 
captive in the fortress. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Huh? ...Linde! What are you
doing here?[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[_0c][01][ShowPortrait][8d][07]Lord Marth! It's great to finally
see you. [WaitForA]
In order to find you, I looked 
all over for your news. [WaitForA]
Then the Medonian soldiers 
captured me, and took me to 
this fortress... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I see. It's good to see that 
you're safe. Coming here by 
yourself was a dangerous 
thing to do. [WaitForA]
But, why were you looking for 
me? Shouldn't you be by 
Nyna's side? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Princess Nyna wanted me to 
give this to you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
? ...!! That's the Fire Emblem! [WaitForA]
Isn't that the Akaneia royal 
family's treasured Emblem 
shield?! [WaitForA]
But why give it to me? Right 
now, shouldn't Akaneia be 
prospering under Emperor 
Hardin's mighty rule...? [WaitForA]
In this peaceful age, why has 
Nyna given the "Conqueror's 
Proof" to somebody like me...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I don't know either. Nyna didn't
say anything and just told me 
to give it to you...  [WaitForA]
I don't know why, but her eyes 
seemed so sad... As if she had 
been crying very hard... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Nyna!? Why... [WaitForA]
Linde, regardless. It's 
dangerous for you to go alone. 
After this battle is over, we 
will return to Nyna. [WaitForA]
Before that time comes, you 
will travel together with us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Understood, Lord Marth! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
