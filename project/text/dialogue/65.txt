[ShowPortrait][00][06]Nyna. We'll be able to see Pales
very soon.  [WaitForA]
It must hold such painful 
memories for you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][61][05]Ah... The fall of Pales, I can 
still see it in my mind's eyes. [WaitForA]
So many people were killed. [WaitForA]
The royals were all taken to 
the castle gate and executed 
in public, as a warning to 
everyone. [WaitForA]
After managing to escape, I 
turned back to see father and 
mother, but they were no 
longer what they used to be. [WaitForA]
It brought such a terrible 
shock to me... I wanted to cry, 
but nothing came out. [WaitForA]
All I felt was sorrow and 
regret... [WaitForA]
But that was already in the 
past. Now is not the time to be 
reminiscing. [WaitForA]
Go, Marth, to the streets 
where I was born, to Akaneia's 
royal capital of Pales. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
