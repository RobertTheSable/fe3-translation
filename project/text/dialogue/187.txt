[ShowPortrait][33][07]Marth... Can you hear me...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Ah, Gotoh! Yes, I can hear 
you... You're using the power 
of magic to talk to me, right? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes... You summoned me? I will 
share with you my strength. 
What is it that you wish for? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Gotoh! There's something I 
want you to tell me. Why was 
Hardin changed so suddenly? [WaitForA]
Also, what is the power that is 
protecting him? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm... that would be the [SetColor][00][28]
Darksphere. [SetColor][00][24]The Darksphere 
is what's shielding Hardin... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The Darksphere? What's that? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm... I guess I have no 
choice but to tell you. [WaitForA]
In this world, there exist 5 [SetColor][00][28]
sacred Spheres [SetColor][00][24]containing 
mysterious power. [WaitForA]
Aside from the [SetColor][00][28]Light, [SetColor][00][24][SetColor][00][28]Star [SetColor][00][24]and [SetColor][00][28]
Geosphere [SetColor][00][24]that you have 
seen. [WaitForA]
There is also the [SetColor][00][28]Lifesphere [SetColor][00][24]
and what is known as the... 
Darksphere. [WaitForA]
The Darksphere opposes the 
Lightsphere, and it can 
greatly increase the strength 
of one's mind. [WaitForA]
It can give its owner courage, 
release them from suffering, 
and increase their ambitions 
and wishes. [WaitForA]
And, during battles, it can 
control the enemy's mind as 
well and prevent them from 
moving. [WaitForA]
But, the Darksphere is too 
dangerous for humans to use. [WaitForA]
It will react with humans' 
anger, disdain and jealousy 
causing them to increase 
tenfold. [WaitForA]
Eventually it will destroy their 
soul and turn them into a 
monster. [WaitForA]
I don't know how Hardin 
obtained the Darksphere. But 
after that... His heart was 
consumed by darkness. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
How could that... Why...? 
Hardin shouldn't be such a 
weak man. [WaitForA]
He should be happy for being 
able to marry his beloved 
Nyna. Why should he be 
jealous...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness... Humans aren't 
simple creatures. [WaitForA]
But, regardless, as long as 
Hardin has the Darksphere you 
cannot win. [WaitForA]
The only thing that can defeat 
the Darksphere is the 
Lightsphere. [WaitForA]
If you want to defeat him, you 
must come to me to obtain it. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? Gotoh, really? With the 
Lightsphere we can save 
Hardin...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm... If his heart has not 
been completely consumed, 
perhaps he can be saved. [WaitForA]
But that depends on whether 
Hardin is really as 
strong-willed as you say... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Thanks, Gotoh! Please allow 
me to borrow the Lightsphere. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm, but I have one condition. [WaitForA]
If you can reach the Ice 
Dragon Shrine, where I am, I 
will hand over the Lightsphere 
to you. [WaitForA]
But, that won't be an easy 
task. There has only been one 
human that has ever made it 
here. [WaitForA]
That's right... The hero Anri. If 
you, like Anri, are a true hero, 
I will lend you the Sphere. [WaitForA]
Well, Marth. Do you have the 
courage to challenge Anri's 
Way? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Yes! Of course!! Please let me 
go there! I must obtain that 
Lightsphere! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Then, first head directly 
north, across the Marmotord 
Desert, and then come to 
Thabes Tower. [WaitForA]
I will have somebody meet you 
there. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Okay, I understand. I'll be 
there for sure!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[CloseFrame][03]
