[ShowPortrait][93][04]Marth...? As a servant of the 
Empire, you dared to invade 
Pales. [WaitForA]
I am disappointed in you. So 
Altea's Prince of Light is just 
a lowlife. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][90][07]Hardin! You are being 
controlled by the Darksphere, 
and have lost your just heart!! [WaitForA]
Please, you must return to 
normal! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hahaha...! You are so naive, 
Marth. I attacked Altea solely 
because of my hatred of you. [WaitForA]
In the previous war, it was 
only because you were the 
descendent of Anri that Nyna 
gave the Emblem to you, [WaitForA]
and chose you to become the 
leader of the alliance. [WaitForA]
Prince of Light... What 
nonsense! [WaitForA]
If you hadn't received my 
support you would have died 
long ago, so don't act all big, 
Marth!! [WaitForA]
From that day on, I hated you. I
kept silent for Nyna, but I 
knew I would have to deal with 
you eventually.  [WaitForA]
This has nothing to do with 
this Sphere! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Hardin... Is that true... Your 
hatred of me... I didn't know... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Ha... That's why you're just a 
boy. Marth! Come to me, so I 
can use my Gradivus to pierce 
your heart!! [WaitForA]
In this tiny continent, I am the 
only hero that is needed! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
