[ShowPortrait][0f][07]Miss Lena, wake up! It's me, 
Julian. What should I do? [WaitForA]
I know I'm a man with no merits,
but for you I will do anything. [WaitForA]
I don't have any other wishes, 
I just want to see you smile, 
Miss Lena. Smile, I'm begging 
you, Miss Lena...  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][10][04]Oh... Julian... You did come. [WaitForA]
I believed that you would 
definitely come. So that's how 
I could endure the horrors 
that I faced... [WaitForA]
Julian, I'm sorry. I always 
acted like a spoilt brat to you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No... Just hearing Miss Lena's 
words is enough for me. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Julian, can you listen to a 
request of mine? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? Oh, please ask, as long 
as I can do it... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
From now on, just call me Lena. 
It seems so impersonal when 
you call me Miss Lena. [WaitForA]
Because we're going to return 
to Medon, to live together. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? ...Miss Lena... Oh... No... I 
meant Le... na... [WaitForA]
Do you really mean that... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... I believe the deities will 
forgive me. Because of my... 
love for you. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
