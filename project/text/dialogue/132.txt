[ShowPortait][60][07]Your highness, look. 
That is Medeus's castle. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][00][04]... We've finally reached it. 
But why hasn't Medeus left the 
castle to fight? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
According to Gotoh, Medeus 
hasn't completely resurrected. [WaitForA]
Therefore he can only assume 
dragon form inside his castle, 
where the power of the seal 
does not affect... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Power of the seal? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes. I don't really understand 
either, but it seems it was  
created by the deities to 
protect humans from the evil 
dragon tribes. [WaitForA]
In this world there exists 
something known as the 
"Binding Shield". [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I have heard of that as well. [WaitForA]
It is mentioned in the legends 
of the Guardian God, Naga. [WaitForA]
But I thought it was all just a 
myth. [WaitForA]
If the Binding Shield truly 
exists, then why has Medeus 
appeared? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, that I... [WaitForA]
Anyway now is our chance, 
before he resurrects 
completely. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Yes. We've come all this way, 
and we're so close to 
returning peace. [WaitForA]
Okay, let's go, to Doluna! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
