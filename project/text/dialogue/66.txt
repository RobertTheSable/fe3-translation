[ShowPortrait][00][07]Nyna, this is Pales castle. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][61][04]Ah! Pales... At last, Pales. [WaitForA]
It's so great... I have finally 
returned. [WaitForA]
But there should still be many 
captive knights in the castle. [WaitForA]
I really want to help them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I understand. The enemy's 
reinforcements haven't come 
yet. [WaitForA]
We'll charge into the castle. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
