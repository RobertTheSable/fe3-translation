[ShowPortrait][26][04]That's great, Sheema. Now I 
can finally leave without 
worry. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][89][07]Samson... Can you not leave...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You don't need me anymore. 
From now on Prince Marth will 
protect you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Don't leave! I don't want you 
to leave... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh, what? Why do keep me? It 
doesn't seem like you. [WaitForA]
...Fine. If you say you need me, 
I won't go anywhere else. [WaitForA]
I will protect you wherever you
may go. Is that fine with you? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
