[ShowPortrait][4e][05]Come, boy, you want to stop 
me again? This time I won't 
spare you!!  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][90][06]Gharnef, give my sister and 
the others back!! Where have 
you taken them!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]

Hahahaha... Those clerics are 
going to become sacrifices for 
the resurrection of the Shadow
Dragon.  [WaitForA]
They are lost forever. [WaitForA]
Soon, the Earth Dragon King, 
Medeus, will be reborn in his 
true form, and we require the 
clerics as live sacrifices. [WaitForA]
However their souls shattered 
because they couldn't stand 
the pain. Not even I can help 
them now. [WaitForA]
Thanks to them, the Shadow 
Dragon will awaken. He no 
longer fears even the power 
of the Binding Shield. [WaitForA]
It's a shame that everything's 
already over. Marth... You will 
die here!!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
