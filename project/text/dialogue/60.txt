[ShowPortrait][92][04]Greetings, Prince Marth. I am 
Minerva of Medon. [WaitForA]
Thank you for rescuing Maria. [WaitForA]
We were on opposing sides in 
the past, but now we no longer 
need to be enemies. [WaitForA]
My brother, Michalis, led the 
majority of Medon to side with 
the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
He was also the cause of my 
father's death...[WaitForA]
If possible, I want to defeat 
him with my own hands. [WaitForA]
Also, please help me rescue my 
subordinates. [WaitForA]
They are the three sisters, 
Palla, Catria and Est, of the 
Whitewings. [WaitForA]
The Dolunian Empire feared 
they would rebel, so they 
separated them from my side.[WaitForA]
But if they knew I was still 
alive, they would come back 
for me.[WaitForA]
The citizens of Medon are 
suffering under the Dolunian 
Empire...[WaitForA]
Please let us fight together 
with your highness. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
