[ShowPortrait][61][04]Thank you, Prince Marth. It 
was all thanks to your help 
that we could return to Pales. [WaitForA]
This radiant bow is called 
Parthia. It is one of three 
weapons passed down by my 
royal family. [WaitForA]
Also, there is the Mercurius 
Sword and the Gradivus lance. 
It seems those two were taken 
by the enemy. [WaitForA]
If we could obtain those 
powerful weapons, your 
battles would become slightly 
easier... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
