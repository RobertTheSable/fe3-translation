[ShowPortrait][18][04]Have you seen a young girl by 
the name of Tiki? [WaitForA]
Tiki is the [SetColor][00][2c]Naga [SetColor][00][24]tribe's sole 
survivor. [WaitForA]
Without this child, there will be 
nobody to defeat the 
Manaketes that serve Medeus. [WaitForA]
I am a Fire Dragon, but I lost 
something important at 
Pyrathi so I cannot fight 
anymore.[WaitForA]
Regardless, I will come along 
with you. Please help me find 
Tiki. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
