[ShowPortrait][8f][06]Marth!! It's been a long time, 
it's me Tiki! I really missed you.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][05]Huh... Tiki!? You came here to 
meet us? That's right... You're 
with Gotoh right now.  [WaitForA]
But, I haven't seen you for a 
while and you've grown. Have 
you been well? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Uh... I've been really lonely. 
You didn't come to visit me... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I'm sorry... But, I hadn't 
forgotten about you, Tiki. [WaitForA]
I wanted to ask you to come to 
Altea, after things had settled 
down. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Marth... ...I love you‚ù§  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh...!? [WaitForA][PlaySong][0e][80][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][28][06][ClearFrame]
...As if. I wouldn't say 
something like that. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
X... Xane!!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ah, I'm really sorry. I couldn't 
help it after seeing that 
serious expression on your 
face... [WaitForA]
Sorry, don't be angry. I was 
ordered, by Gotoh, to wait 
here for you. [WaitForA]
While I was waiting I got more 
and more angry, wondering why 
I had to do something so 
boring. [WaitForA]
So I thought I'd think of a 
prank to pull on you. [WaitForA]
But, my Tiki impression was 
pretty good wasn't it? [WaitForA]
Huh, what's with the anxious 
face? Okay, let's go. You want 
to meet Gotoh, right? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Xane, how would you know 
Gotoh? Who are you? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, that doesn't really matter. 
Well, don't just stand there. 
Follow me. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
