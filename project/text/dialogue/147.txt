[ShowPortrait][31][06]It seems the Empire's 
reinforcements have come. It's
already reached this stage...  [WaitForA]
Lord Ogma, I am deeply sorry 
for getting you involved in all 
of this. [WaitForA]
But, could you listen to one 
last request of mine? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][0d][07]I was sent here by King Talys 
to help you. If there is 
anything I can do for you, 
please ask. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][31][06]Is that so...? Then, I ask of 
you... Please send these 
children to Medon. [WaitForA]
These children... Prince 
Yubello and Princess Yumina 
are the children of the late 
King Grust. [WaitForA]
I have always been protecting 
them in secret, but that is no 
longer possible. [WaitForA]
If they fell into General Lang's 
hands, I bet he would execute 
them without question. [WaitForA]
Please, take these children to 
Wendell at Medon. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][0d][07]I understand... I will protect 
these two with my life. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][31][06]Truly? Thank you... Well, 
Prince Yubello, Princess 
Yumina, you will escape with 
Lord Ogma. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7c][07]No! I won't go. If we must 
escape, Lorenz must come with 
us too. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][31][06]Princess Yumina... I am afraid I 
cannot leave. My body is in 
such agony that even walking 
pains me. [WaitForA]
So, please don't worry about 
me. You two must flee. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7c][07]Why... Why must you say 
that...? [WaitForA]
Lorenz, you fought to protect 
us. That's why you suffered 
such a heavy wound. [WaitForA]
How can you tell us to leave 
you!? I will not go. I will not 
leave your side!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][0d][07]What should we do, General?[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][31][06]Hmm... This is troublesome. 
Yumina will undoubtedly stick 
to her word... [WaitForA]
I apologise, Lord Ogma. You 
may leave. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][0d][07]I understand... Then, I will find 
another way to help you. [WaitForA]
I will find Lang and kill him... I 
will use my blade to send him to 
his grave. [WaitForA]
If I succeed, perhaps the 
nearby enemies will retreat. [WaitForA]
General Lorenz, you must live 
to see that day. 
Don't get yourself killed!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
