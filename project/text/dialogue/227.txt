[ShowPortrait][02][07]Marth, it's finally over. Now, 
the world is safe. Look, the 
princesses are over there... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Sister! And there's Princess 
Nyna... And Lena and Maria as 
well. [WaitForA]
It's great to see that 
everybody is safe. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][61][07]Marth, you finally came. I am so
happy... I will need your help to 
restore Akaneia.  [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][32][06]You really worked hard, Marth. 
You are my pride. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][10][07]Lord Marth, with our combined 
strength we have already 
vanquished Gharnef. Please 
relax. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][1d][06]The world is safe now. Your 
highness, please hurry back to 
Altea. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really? It's good to see 
everybody well. But you all 
don't look too good... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][61][07]Everybody is tired from 
battling Gharnef. But it 
doesn't matter now, so please 
don't worry. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? Nyna, I am sorry 
about Hardin. I couldn't save 
him. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
It's fine. He was devoured by 
his own ambitions, so it is not 
unexpected that he was lost. [WaitForA]
Well, Marth, you should hurry 
back to your homeland. 
Everybody is probably worried 
about you. [WaitForA]
With your remaining time, you 
must live well. [WaitForA]
As long as there are still 
people in this world, your name 
will never be forgotten. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
