[ShowPortrait][63][04]Oh, Prince Marth. It is good to 
see you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Huh, aren't you King Aurelis?! 
What are you doing here? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I came here to stop my 
country's army. Also I must 
apologise to your highness. [WaitForA]
I believed Hardin's words and 
followed Akaneia, but I now 
realise my wrongs. [WaitForA]
Akaneia's Empress Nyna 
secretly sent me a letter, 
saying that Hardin isn't normal 
and is ill... [WaitForA]
My country will remain neutral, 
and its knights will return to 
Aurelis. I hope you won't 
attack my men anymore. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I understand, your highness. I 
don't want to fight with you. [WaitForA]
Please forgive me for taking 
so many of your knights' lives. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh! You really are like what 
the rumours say. [WaitForA]
My body is frail and I have no 
children, and even Hardin, my 
younger brother, has 
completely changed. [WaitForA]
Prince Marth, please protect 
Aurelis in my place. I will hand 
my whole country to you. [WaitForA]
I give this jewel to you as a 
gift. This is a magical jewel 
containing the divine power of 
life. [WaitForA]
I spent a lot of gold to buy it 
from a travelling merchant. I 
believe it will be useful to you. [WaitForA]
Don't worry about Hardin. 
Since he is a knight, it is 
natural for him to die in battle. [WaitForA]
That is his fate. [WaitForA]
Well, Prince Marth, I will go on 
ahead. I hope you will all be 
safe... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
