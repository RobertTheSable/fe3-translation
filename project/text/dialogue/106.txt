[_88][04][ShowPortait][67][04]Please listen carefully, this is 
very important. To the south 
west are two villages. [WaitForA]
At the western village resides 
a paladin called Arran. [WaitForA]
At the eastern village resides 
a hero called Samson. [WaitForA]
Those two are both very 
strong men. However, the two 
villages don't get on well with 
one another. [WaitForA]
So, only one of them can 
become an ally. [WaitForA]
Please think carefully before 
making a decision. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
