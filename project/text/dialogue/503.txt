[ShowPortrait][69][04]General Lorenz recovered the 
children from Wendell, hoping 
to raise them at Grust. [WaitForA]
When the Emperor found out, 
he ordered him to hand over 
the children. [WaitForA]
The general hid the children 
away because he feared they 
would be killed. [WaitForA]
Following that, he lost his 
power and then Commander 
Lang came. [WaitForA]
In order to find the children, 
Lang performed many 
atrocities. [WaitForA]
Eventually we rebelled 
because we could no longer 
stand him. [WaitForA]
But, everything's over. The 
people of this country will all 
be killed by Lang! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
