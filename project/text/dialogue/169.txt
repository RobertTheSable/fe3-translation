[ShowPortrait][83][04]Hahaha... They're here? [WaitForA]
Our reinforcements will be 
arriving soon. If we hold out 
long enough, we'll be able to 
attack them from both sides. [WaitForA]
Swordfighter Nabarl! When 
they open the gate that will be 
your chance to attack. [WaitForA]
Don't hold back, just kill them 
all!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][12][07]Uh... Okay. The Altean knights 
are, um, nothing to me. Yeah... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh! I should have expected no 
less from you. [WaitForA]
As long as we have you, not 
even Talys's Ogma can defeat 
us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What? Ogma!!? Uh... Um... 
Yeah... I can, er, take care of 
that dude. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Good, with your words I can 
relax now. Well, good luck, 
Nabarl! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
