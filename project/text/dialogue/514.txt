[ShowPortrait][83][07]Ah... Lord Marth. You finally 
caught the rebels? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][06]General Lang! Wait! Those 
children are innocent. Can you 
hand them to us? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][83][07]That isn't possible. Prisoners 
of war must be taken to my 
castle. [WaitForA]
I must also execute them as 
soon as possible, so that 
other people dare not defy us. [WaitForA]
Ah, your highness. You must 
head immediately to Medon. [WaitForA]
The Medonian army has 
rebelled, and its princess 
appears to have been 
captured by them. [WaitForA]
Emperor Hardin has ordered 
that you go and rescue 
Princess Minerva. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][06]What? Medon? I understand, 
General. If it's to rescue 
Princess Minerva, I will gladly 
go. [WaitForA]
But, please hand those 
children to me. I beg of you, 
General Lang! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][83][07]Don't be stubborn, your 
highness! When I said no, I 
meant it. [WaitForA]
Well, you two, come over here! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7c][06]No, let go of me! Yubello, help 
me! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7d][07]Yumina... Yumina... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][06]Wait, wait!! Lang! Release 
those children! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
