[ShowPortrait][01][07]Lord Marth... [WaitForA]
I can finally return to Talys. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][00][04]Mmm... Shiida. [WaitForA]
You must go back to report to 
your father, right? [WaitForA]
But if you don't return to 
Altea immediately afterwards, 
then... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
...Yes....? [WaitForA]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Uh... Well... these lands, which 
have been ruined by war, must 
be restored as soon as 
possible. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][61][06]Haha, Marth, always leaving 
the most important things until 
last. [WaitForA]
If you're a hero, then don't try 
to beat around the bush! [WaitForA]
Go ahead and tell Shiida about 
your feelings. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]

Ah, my head... [WaitForA]
Shiida... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][01][07]Oh! Ye-yes!? [SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I hope... [WaitForA]
That you and I can go back 
together to Altea... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
! ...Yes. [WaitForA]
I would like that... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
