[_89][5e][80][ShowPortait][33][04]Marth, you may leave. I will use 
my magic to send you to Altea 
instantly. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][8b][07]Gotoh, aren't you coming along 
with us? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh... I have something to 
investigate right now. You 
see, Gharnef has already 
began to act. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Gharnef...!? But isn't he dead?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, his body was destroyed, 
but his vile spirit lives on in 
the Darksphere.  [WaitForA]
He also awakened the evil 
priests that served him, and 
they appear to be planning 
something terrible. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? I see, Gotoh. Well, 
we'll move out then. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Once I find anything, I 
will contact you immediately. [WaitForA]
Good luck, Marth. Everything 
is in your hands. Please 
rescue dragons and humans 
from the path to ruin. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
