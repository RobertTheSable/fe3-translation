[ShowPortait][33][04]Tiki... Don't be so happy. Many 
people died in this battle. [WaitForA]
Marth, to you, this victory is 
also painful. Losing your loved 
ones, and having to live all 
alone. [WaitForA]
Marth, I'm sorry... You've 
saved the future of this 
world, but have lost your most 
important things... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
