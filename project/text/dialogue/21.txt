[ShowPortrait][01][07]Swordfighter Nabarl! [WaitForA]
Why would a person like you 
become a bodyguard for these 
bandits? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][12][04]...!? Huh, who are you? [WaitForA]
I have no business with women 
or children! Get out of here!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Please, stop this unnecessary 
fighting... and lend your 
strength to us. [WaitForA]
If you're unwilling, you can cut 
me down with your sword right 
now. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...I won't point my sword at 
women. [WaitForA]
Since you risked your own life 
to request for me, I don't have 
a choice... I will lend my 
strength to you. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
