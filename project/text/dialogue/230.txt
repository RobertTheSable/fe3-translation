[ShowPortrait][8b][04]So this is the Dragon's Table, 
where the Divine Dragon Naga 
sealed away the Earth 
Dragons... [WaitForA]
But, wasn't Medeus the 
guardian of the altar...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][33][07]Medeus could not tolerate the 
humans' actions against the 
Manaketes. [WaitForA]
So he gathered the other 
dragon tribes and formed the 
Doluna Empire, to destroy 
mankind. [WaitForA]
First he was defeated by Anri, 
and second by you.[WaitForA]
But, Earth Dragons can't be 
destroyed easily due to their 
powerful life force... [WaitForA]
Medeus is now sleeping in the 
altar. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
He's going to resurrect 
again!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No, even an Earth Dragon 
shouldn't wake within a 
hundred years. Medeus is now 
changing his form. [WaitForA]
When he next awakens, he will 
become a fearful Shadow 
Dragon... No... Could it be... 
So that's why... Why Gharnef... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh, what is it, Gotoh!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Prince Marth, I finally 
understand why the clerics 
have been taken. [WaitForA]
Gharnef plans to use them to 
resurrect Medeus. [WaitForA]
To awaken a dragon requires 
the life force of females with 
pure and noble blood. [WaitForA]
Gharnef knew about this, so 
he went to capture the clerics. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
So my sister and the others 
are inside the altar? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... Marth, we must hurry. 
The clerics are in grave 
danger. [WaitForA]
Medeus... He is going to 
resurrect once again!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[CloseFrame][03]
