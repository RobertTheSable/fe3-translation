[ShowPortrait][4c][06]Gotoh, the allied army has 
come. [WaitForA]
This place is going to become a 
battlefield. 
Please leave to safety. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][33][07]Mmm... I understand. [WaitForA]
but Michalis, you truly are a 
fool. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][4c][06][_17][ef][ff][Exclaim2].... 
[_16][10][00]Why did you call me a fool!? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][33][07]You love Minerva and she 
deeply respects you. [WaitForA]
Since you were young, you two 
both discussed the future of 
this country, and put much 
effort into both martial arts 
and study. [WaitForA]
With your combined strength, 
Medon would eventually 
become as strong a country as 
Akeneia. [WaitForA]
However you let yourself be 
deceived by Gharnef, [WaitForA]
becoming obsessed with 
pointless ambition, which 
would lead this country down 
the path of ruin...[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][4c][06]...That is already in the past. [WaitForA]
Minerva betrayed me and 
betrayed this country... [WaitForA]
But, Gotoh, I haven't lost yet. [WaitForA]
I still have the Medonian 
royal family's treasured [SetColor][00][28]Iote's 
Shield. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA]
With this I needn't fear even 
arrows. That boy... [WaitForA]
I will personally slay Altea's 
Marth, for you to see. [WaitForA]
That is my final will, as king of 
Medon! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][33][07]Really...? Then I have nothing 
more to say. [WaitForA]
Go! Michalis, go and punish 
yourself, for the crime of 
killing your own father!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
