[ShowPortrait][4d][04]Hahaha... Marth, so you've 
returned to die. [WaitForA]
I am Emperor Medeus's right 
hand man, Morzas of the 
Basilisk. [WaitForA]
A pity though that you've 
returned so late. Your mother, 
Liza, already died by my hands. [WaitForA]
And your sister, Princess 
Elice, is now in Gharnef's 
possession. [WaitForA]
Hahaha... Regret, for you 
cannot defeat me. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
