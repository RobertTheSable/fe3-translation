[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Jagen, how is the situation at 
the castle? Have they found 
Minerva yet? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]Right, about that... Although 
the enemy has fled, there 
seems to be no trace of the 
princess.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh, why is that? Minerva 
should have been taken here... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ah... Your highness, General 
Lang appears to have arrived. [WaitForA]
I wonder what kind of 
nonsensical request he's going 
to give us this time. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
