[ShowPortrait][0d][07]Nabarl... You disappoint me... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][12][04]Woah, I don't believe it... This 
Killing Edge is, like, so 
deadly... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Do we have to fight? Alright. I 
guessed that we would have to 
duel eventually. [WaitForA][_89][4c][80][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][82][04]Ah... Oh, snap! Woah dude! I'm 
just faking it! ...Faking! [WaitForA]
It's me... Samto. Have you 
totally forgotten, Mister 
Ogma? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Samto!? The pit-fighter from 
Knorda, Samto? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Yeah, that was me. Thanks for 
saving me back then. [WaitForA]
When everybody tried to 
escape, you got yourself 
caught, to hide our escape... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
[_17][ef][ff]..... [WaitForA]

I heard from the others that 
you were taken to the arena to 
be whipped. [WaitForA]
Even then, you didn't say 
anything about our 
whereabouts. [WaitForA]
In the end, the young princess 
of Talys, who was passing by, 
protected you even when she 
was in tears, and rescued you. [WaitForA]
So, that is why, for Talys... 
No... For the princess, you 
wielded your sword again... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Enough... Don't say anymore! 
It's already in the past... In the
past...  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
.....Mister Ogma... Regardless, I 
hope to repay your favour! Let 
me follow you, okay? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
