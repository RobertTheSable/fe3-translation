[ShowPortrait][02][07]Your highness! We've found 
bishop Wendell held captive in 
the castle. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][06]Ah, bishop Wendell! It's great 
to see that you're safe. [WaitForA]
When I heard you were taken 
from the village in Medon, I 
was really worried. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][29][05]Lang wanted me to help him 
deal with the Grustian 
rebellion, so he took me here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
But, as the Pontifex of 
Khadein, and with your power, 
you shouldn't need to fear 
Lang. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I don't like using magic in 
battle. [WaitForA]
And also, I already left the 
magic city, Khadein, in the 
care of the two youths, Merric 
and Elrean. [WaitForA]
I left because I must carry out 
an important mission given to 
me by Archsage Gotoh. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
A mission from Gotoh? So, are 
you travelling the continent? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
That's right... [WaitForA]
You should know that there 
was once a sacred jewel, with 
markings of the 12 
constellations, known as the [WaitForA]
Starsphere. [WaitForA]
In order to dispel Gharnef's 
dark magic, Gotoh created the 
holy Starlight magic from the 
Sphere. [WaitForA]
However, at that time it 
created a powerful shock and 
the Sphere broke into 12 
fragments, which flew and [WaitForA]
scattered across the 
continent. [WaitForA]
Gotoh said that this world is 
protected by the mysterious 
power of the five Spheres. [WaitForA]
If any one of them was lost, 
the world will fall into ruin. [WaitForA]
And right now, the Starsphere 
has been broken. Therefore, 
even now the world is 
decaying. [WaitForA]
The 12 fragments must be 
brought back together, so 
that the Starsphere can be 
restored. [WaitForA]
Unfortunately, I was captured 
and the fragments that I 
laboriously collected were 
taken by the imperial soldiers. [WaitForA]
Prince Marth. I realise that I 
cannot complete my mission 
just by myself. Can you aid me 
in my quest? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh... How could this be...? 
Suddenly hearing that the 
world is falling into ruin. [WaitForA]
I am finding it difficult to 
believe. But, are the Star 
fragments these? [WaitForA]
I already have a couple. Once 
I've reclaimed Altea, I will help 
you look for the remaining 
fragments and Spheres. [WaitForA]
If possible, can you wait until 
then? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, that's right... Your 
highness's country was 
attacked by Akaneia... [WaitForA]
I am deeply sorry. My request 
was a little selfish. Your 
highness, I understand... [WaitForA]
I will also fight, to reclaim 
Altea. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? Bishop, can you really 
help us fight? What about 
Gotoh's mission...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I bet meeting your highness 
was also planned by Gotoh. [WaitForA]
If that is the case, I must 
follow my fate. But, can we 
first go to the Fane of Raman? [WaitForA]
At that ancient temple, 
perhaps we can recover some 
of the lost Spheres and Star 
fragments. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I understand. The Fane of 
Raman is along our road to 
reclaiming Altea. [WaitForA]
We'll head there immediately!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
