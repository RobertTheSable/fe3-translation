[ShowPortrait][0d][04]Yumina, Yubello. This place is 
the territory of the dreaded 
Medonian Vikings. [WaitForA]
Originally, I didn't want to 
come here, but we must cross 
through here to reach the 
bishop. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]

[ShowPortrait][7d][05]Ogma, I'm scared... I want to... 
go back... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][7c][06]Yubello! Be strong, you're a 
man!! Remember, you can use 
fire magic to attack with! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
But Mister Wendell told me not 
to use it to fight with... Not 
that I like to fight anyway... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Honestly, you're still making 
excuses? Right now it's just 
the two of us. [WaitForA]
If you don't become strong, I... 
I don't know what to do... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh... Yumina... I will try my 
best... So please don't cry. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]

Crap... This is bad... We've 
been discovered. No choice, 
we'll have to break through 
them. [WaitForA]
You two, stay close to me! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
