[ShowPortait][20][06]Astram, how are you doing? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][2b][05]So it's the traitor, Jeorge. 
What do you want with me? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Wait, Astram. General Eibel has 
already fallen. [WaitForA]
You won't be able to win even 
if you continue fighting. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You want me to surrender...? 
Never! [WaitForA]
Even if I am the last one 
standing. I am a warrior of 
Akeneia to the end!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Why are you... Who are you 
fighting for? Are you fighting 
for Emperor Hardin? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No! It's not because of that 
man, but because of Nyna... 
And for Akaneia!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
But, did Nyna tell you to fight 
here? [WaitForA]
Do you really think that Nyna 
would hope for this kind of 
battle? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Well... I hadn't seen Nyna for a 
while. I was told that she fell 
ill, and that I couldn't see her. [WaitForA]
But... Since Hardin is Emperor 
of Akaneia, I have no choice. [WaitForA]
If I don't follow his orders I will
become a traitor, and I will be 
betraying Nyna.  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Astram, Nyna already 
entrusted the Emblem to 
Prince Marth. [WaitForA]
Do you understand... the 
meaning of her actions? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Wh-what!! When did this 
happen, Jeorge? Nyna 
requested Prince Marth for 
help? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I believe that is the only 
explanation. [WaitForA]
Astram, if you want to find out 
the truth then come with us... [WaitForA]
If you die here, what will Midia 
do? You must live on, for her. [WaitForA]
You must live on, so you can 
confirm with your eyes what is 
happening. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm... I guess I have no choice.[WaitForA]
But, Jeorge. If this war is as 
Hardin said, and was caused 
by Prince Marth's Ambitions.  [WaitForA]
I will never forgive you! 
Remember that!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
