[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Jagen, where is this? Is this 
Medon, or Doluna?  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]We're right at the countries' 
border. This is where Medon's 
wyverns are born. [WaitForA]
However, these lands are 
ruled by savage barbarians. 
Even Medon's soldiers are 
afraid to enter here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
So this is the Wyvern Valley... 
Anyway, Jagen, we need to 
hurry. [WaitForA]
I feel like something is going to
happen to my sister and the 
others. I have a bad feeling.  [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
