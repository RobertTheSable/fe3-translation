[ShowPortrait][26][04]I am Samson. I used to be a 
famous gladiator. [WaitForA]
However, for certain reasons, 
I now reside here. [WaitForA]
I am very happy to be able to 
serve you. [WaitForA]
But this village and its 
neighbouring village haven't 
got on well for a long time. [WaitForA]
Once they know that your 
highness has visited this
village, they will close their
village's gate. [WaitForA]
You should give up thinking of 
trying to recruit Arran. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
