[ShowPortait][90][04]What is this strange air? It 
feels like it's full of evil 
spirits. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][02][07]That is true... My body appears 
to be frozen. These are the 
evil spirits of the Earth 
Dragons. [WaitForA]
Your highness, it seems we 
can't have everybody enter 
ahead. [WaitForA]
Since we don't know what will 
happen, please choose 
carefully who to take with you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I hope to at least take the 
people who are worried about 
the four clerics. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... There's no avoiding 
that. But how many people will 
survive? I bet this will be a 
fierce battle. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
