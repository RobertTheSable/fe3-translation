[ShowPortait][60][07]Prince Marth, I have already 
found the location of Thabes! [WaitForA]
To the far north of Khadein, 
at the Marmotord Desert, 
there appears to be an illusion 
town. [WaitForA]
But those who went to Thabes 
never came back. [WaitForA]
So, what will you do? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][00][04]... [WaitForA]
I must go there, to reclaim the 
Falchion and to rescue my 
sister. [WaitForA]
Gharnef! Watch me. I won't let 
this beautiful world fall into 
your hands!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
