[ShowPortrait][0d][07]Who's there? Are you one of 
the pirates!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][7e][04]I am Sirius, a traveller... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Is that so? I'm sorry. I 
overreacted a little, please 
accept my apologies. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Those children... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Something happened, so I'm 
taking care of them now. You 
know them? [WaitForA][PlaySong][0e][80][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No... But if you're carrying the 
children, you won't be able to 
escape. [WaitForA]
I heard, from a village to the 
south, that the Altean army 
has come. [WaitForA]
Leave this place to me, and 
make your escape. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What!? The Altean army...? So 
Prince Marth... [WaitForA]
I understand. Thanks. But, why
are you helping me?  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I want to help those children. 
That's all... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? So you are Sirus... If 
we escape safely, I hope we 
can meet again. [WaitForA]
I plan on killing the ruler of 
Grust, Commander Lang. So I 
can avenge a man named 
Lorenz. [WaitForA]
You... If you could lend me your 
strength... With you, I believe I 
will be able to succeed. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm... Perhaps it might be 
interesting... However, to do 
that you must live. [WaitForA]
Well, get going! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
