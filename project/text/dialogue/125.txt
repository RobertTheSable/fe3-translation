[ShowPortrait][33][04]Ah, Lord Marth, I am Gotoh. 
Welcome here. [WaitForA]
Really...? You have fulfilled 
our promise and brought both 
the Starsphere and 
Lightsphere here. [WaitForA]
Excellent. Then I can create 
the only spell that can 
penetrate Imhullu, [SetColor][00][28]Starlight. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA]
