[ShowPortrait][0f][06]Hey! That was uncalled for. 
Why do you always keep 
picking on me? [WaitForA]
If you continue like this, you'll 
make Miss Lena sad. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][2c][05]Oh, it's Julian. Are you still 
clinging onto Lena? [WaitForA]
No way, I'm not handing my 
cute sister to a thief like you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Don't worry... Lena and I aren't 
that close. I just want to help 
her, any little that I can. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, I finally understand. 
You're really cool, Julian! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Well, I... uh... never expected 
to hear you say that... [WaitForA]
Nevermind. If you're worried 
about Lena, come with us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, really? Thanks. I was 
forced to join the rebels. I 
didn't really want to fight. [WaitForA]
Well, "little brother", let's join 
forces to find my cute Lena! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
