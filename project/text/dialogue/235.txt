[ShowPortrait][90][04]...! 
[_16][10][00]Isn't that my sister and the 
others!? Who are they 
protecting...? [WaitForA]
Damn... That's... Is that 
Medeus...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]Wait, if the princesses are in 
the way, your highness's sword
will be unable to strike.  [WaitForA]
We must think of something 
fast, otherwise the Earth 
Dragons will awaken, and then 
they will be in even more pain. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What should I do...? How can I 
save them? Please tell me, 
Jagen. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That... Not even I know. To 
defeat Medeus, there is 
probably no other way except 
to... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
[_17][ef][ff]...! 
[_16][10][00]What, you want me to kill 
them!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That is one way. The 
princesses cannot suffer any 
more. [WaitForA]
Taking their life is also a way 
of saving them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Jagen, are you SERIOUSLY 
telling me to make this 
decision? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
As leader, there are times 
when you must make painful 
decisions. That is what I 
meant. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Jagen, that's enough, I 
understand. I will not give up. [WaitForA]
There must be some other way. 
Until the very end, I will not 
give up!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
