[ShowPortait][74][06]King Jiol. The allied army has 
finally come. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][44][07]What do you mean allied army? 
Idiot!! [WaitForA]
Why don't you just call them 
rebels!? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][74][06]Yes, I'm sorry. 
It's just that everybody calls 
them the allied army now, so... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][44][07]Idiot!! Those fools are just a 
bunch of rebels. You shouldn't 
have to fear them. [WaitForA]
I can't believe this. Not only 
did they make it here alive, 
but they're led by the Fire 
Emblem. [WaitForA]
Have you requested 
reinforcements from the 
Dolunian Empire yet?[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][74][06]Yes, a squadron of Pegasus 
Knights are expected to 
arrive soon.[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][44][07]Pegasus Knights?! What good 
can those things do?! [WaitForA]
I specifically requested either 
Camus's Sable Order or 
Michalis's Dragoons. [WaitForA]
Damn it! So that's how they 
treat me? [WaitForA]
They plan on betraying us, 
just as we betrayed 
Cornelius? [WaitForA]
Damn that Gharnef! I don't 
want to die just yet. [WaitForA]
Do you understand what to 
do!? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][74][06]Yes, your highness... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
