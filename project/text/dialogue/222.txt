[ShowPortrait][93][04]Midia, even you betrayed me. 
Akaneia's paladins have lost 
their touch. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][1b][05]You fool!! Don't you see it? 
What you're doing isn't normal. [WaitForA]
Where did you take Nyna to? 
Bring her back to us now!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][93][04]Nyna! That woman betrayed 
me. [WaitForA]
I just wanted to destroy 
Grust. And she had to go and 
give the Emblem to that boy... [WaitForA]
Those who betray me must die. 
Midia, you're no exception!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][1b][05]If you want to take my life, go 
ahead. [WaitForA]
But, Hardin... Do you know how 
much suffering you've caused 
because of your stupid 
jealousy? [WaitForA]
Just open your eyes and see! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][93][04]Stupid jealousy...? Haha. You 
can say what you like. [WaitForA]
This world is corrupt and full 
of annoying people. Is this kind
of world even worth anything? [WaitForA]
It would be far better for it to 
be destroyed.  [WaitForA]
Midia, you shall watch here... 
As Prince Marth dies by hand!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
