[ShowPortrait][33][04]Prince Marth, you  finally came![WaitForA]
I should have expected 
nothing less from the one who 
possesses the heroic bloodline 
of Anri.  [WaitForA]
To reward your courage, I will 
hand the Lightsphere to you. [WaitForA]
With this, the Darksphere will 
lose its power and it will no 
longer be impossible to fight 
Hardin. [WaitForA]
Also, about the Starsphere 
shards... [WaitForA]
What!? You found all the 
shards? Thank you, then the 
Starsphere can be restored. 
Please wait a moment... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
