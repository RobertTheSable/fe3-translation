[ShowPortrait][8b][05]Hey, Xane. Gotoh didn't really 
mention anything about the 
five Spheres, but I thought 
they were very important. [WaitForA]
Do you know anything about 
them? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][28][06]Gotoh was afraid of shocking 
you so he didn't say anything. I
will tell you.  [WaitForA]
However, after I've told you, 
you'll probably think it was 
better off not knowing. [WaitForA]
The spheres rest on the shield 
that seals the Earth Dragons...
Basically they are part of the 
[SetColor][00][28]Binding Shield. [SetColor][00][24][WaitForA]
Since ancient times, the 
Divine Dragons have passed 
down these sacred jewels, 
each possessing different [WaitForA]
powers. [WaitForA]
To put it simply, the shield is 
just a pedestral and the five 
Spheres are what creates the 
power of the seal. [WaitForA]
So if any of the Spheres is 
lost the seal will weaken. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm, is that so? But, how 
comes the Spheres were 
scattered? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Because the shield was 
broken. [WaitForA]
The Binding Shield was 
displayed at the Fane of 
Raman, and it was stolen by 
somebody who ended up [WaitForA]
breaking it... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
When did that happen? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Around 600 years ago. To 
recover the shield, Gotoh 
spent many years searching 
the lands. [WaitForA]
In the end, he only found the 
five Spheres, with the shield 
nowhere to be seen. [WaitForA]
Not only that, but the five 
spheres, which he painfully 
collected, were scattered 
again after the Fane of Raman [WaitForA]
was attacked in the previous 
war. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really? ...So that was why 
Gotoh was looking for the lost 
jewels... the Spheres? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yep, the Star, Light and Geo... 
as well as the Dark and Life 
Spheres. [WaitForA]
The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's 
possession, the Starsphere 
was shattered and the 
Darksphere was given to [WaitForA]
Hardin by Gharnef. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The Geosphere is in Altea, and 
all that remains is the 
Lifesphere. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ah... Anyway, let's enter the 
temple. From now on I will also 
help you fight. Well, let's go! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
