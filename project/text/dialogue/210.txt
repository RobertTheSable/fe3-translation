[ShowPortait][02][07]Lord Marth, if this battle 
continues it will become 
meaningless, and will only give 
more time for Hardin. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][8b][04]Mmm, I was thinking the same. 
If we keep heading east, more 
needless blood will be spilt. [WaitForA]
So I have decided a different 
route for us to go. [WaitForA]
How about we go directly 
south from Menedi, and enter 
Pales from Adria Peak? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
You want the troops to cross 
that dangerous mountain 
path? It's too dangerous... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I am already prepared for 
danger. [WaitForA]
Besides, we were able to 
conquer the dangerious Anri's 
Way, so this should be easy in 
comparison... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
...That's a fair point. If we can 
cross it, we can attack the 
enemy from the rear. [WaitForA]
Understood, we'll try that. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
