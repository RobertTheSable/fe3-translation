[ShowPortrait][33][07]Marth, you have done well. You 
have all five Spheres in your 
possession. [WaitForA]
Because of your efforts, the 
lost [SetColor][00][28]Binding Shield [SetColor][00][24]has finally 
been restored. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Yes! The five Spheres have 
attached onto the royal 
shield... [WaitForA]
So this is the Binding Shield? 
But, Gotoh, what should I do 
next? [WaitForA]
After seeing Gharnef's 
expression, it seems he really 
has taken my sister and the 
others. [WaitForA]
I can't just leave them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm... I understand your 
feelings... But you must first 
restore the seal on the Earth 
Dragons. [WaitForA]
Those beasts will soon awaken 
from their slumber. [WaitForA]
When they appear from the 
ground they will burn 
everything, and create Hell on 
Earth. [WaitForA]
Go, Marth. Send the awakened 
Earth Dragons back into the 
darkness of the seal!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
