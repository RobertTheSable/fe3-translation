[ShowPortrait][0f][05]Your highness, it's been a long 
time. It's me, Julian. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][06]Julian!? Even though I heard 
you went to Medon with Lena, I 
didn't expect to see you 
here... [WaitForA]
Is Lena well? Of course, since 
she is with you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Well... Miss Lena suddenly 
disappeared... I... What should I 
do? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? Wait, Julian, what 
happened? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Miss Lena vanished yesterday. [WaitForA]
I heard from the villagers that 
a nasty-looking bishop came 
by. It seems Miss Lena was 
taken by him. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
A bishop...? Julian! I heard 
Princess Maria has also gone 
missing. [WaitForA]
I have a bad feeling about all 
of this. [WaitForA]
Anyway, staying here won't 
achieve anything. You should 
come with us. [WaitForA]
I am also worried about Lena. 
We can help you look for her. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]

Your highness... Thank you. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
