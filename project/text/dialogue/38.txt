[_88][00][PlaySong][0a][80][ShowPortrait][61][04]You are Prince Marth? Finally, 
I have a chance to meet with 
you. I am Nyna of Akaneia. [WaitForA]
Our Kingdom of Akaneia, the 
guardian of this world, was 
destroyed by the Dolunian 
empire.[WaitForA]
The world is now facing ruin. 
Prince Marth, I have a 
request...[WaitForA]
Please, in my place, lead these 
soldiers who were defeated by 
the Empire and liberate the 
countries ruled by Doluna. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][00][07]Of course, Nyna. In the past, 
Altea has been loyal to 
Akaneia. [WaitForA]
And as a descendant of Altea's 
founder, it is my destiny to 
defeat Doluna's Shadow 
Dragon, Medeus. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Thank you, Prince Marth. 
Then, I will give this Emblem to 
you. [WaitForA]
This [SetColor][00][28]Fire Emblem [SetColor][00][24]is the symbol 
of the Akaneia royal family. [WaitForA]
It is the proof of a conqueror, 
and given to the saviour of 
the world. [WaitForA]
With this, you can also open 
chests that contain valuable 
treasures. [WaitForA]
This war will be fierce, but 
please try your best to return 
light to this world. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
