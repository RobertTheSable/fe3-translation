[ShowPortait][29][07]Elrean! What are you doing?!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][87][04]Oh, Master Wendell. You've 
returned... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
You still don't understand my 
actions? You are indeed a 
talented magician. [WaitForA]
But you don't have a caring 
heart, and that is why I didn't 
pass on Excalibur to you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
... A caring heart...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Before, I had already decided 
that, when the time was right, 
you would become my 
successor. [WaitForA]
But what you're doing now is 
betraying your own will... How 
are you different from 
Gharnef? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
You're comparing me with the 
Dark Pontifex, Gharnef? 
Please, Master! That's too 
much. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Listen to me... Gharnef and 
Miloah were both Gotoh's most 
talented students. [WaitForA]
But Gotoh saw that Gharnef's 
inner heart was weak, so he 
gave the Aura tome and 
Khadein to Miloah. [WaitForA]
Driven mad by jealousy, 
Gharnef stole the Darksphere 
from Gotoh, and created the 
Imhullu spell. [WaitForA]
As a result... His heart was 
corrupted by the Darksphere. [WaitForA]
Originally Gharnef was a youth 
with a strong sense of justice. 
But his jealousy led him down 
the path of destruction. [WaitForA]
Elrean, do you understand 
now...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Master... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That is all I can say to 
you. I hope you will 
understand. [WaitForA]
You still have many things to 
learn, and your will is too 
weak. [WaitForA]
Do you really intend on 
retreading Gharnef's path? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Master! I'm really sorry, I... 
see my wrongs. Please forgive 
me! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Elrean, you should begin by 
letting your strength be used 
by others... Understood? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
