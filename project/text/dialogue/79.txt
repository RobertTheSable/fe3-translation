[ShowPortrait][60][07]Prince Marth, we searched the 
whole castle, but the divine 
Falchion sword is nowhere to 
be found. [WaitForA]
It seems the rumours were 
true. It has already been taken
away by Gharnef.  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][00][04]Really...? But, without the 
Falchion we cannot defeat 
Medeus. [WaitForA]
...I'm sorry everyone, but even 
though Altea is so close now, 
we must go to Khadein. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
