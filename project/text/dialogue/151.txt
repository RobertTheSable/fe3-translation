[ShowPortrait][1c][07]Warren!? Even you've joined 
the rebels...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][79][04]Whitewing, Catria, it's been a 
long time. [WaitForA]
I am just a hunter. I'll do 
anything as long as I get paid. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]

Warren, listen to me! Princess 
Minerva worked hard to create 
a country where everybody 
can live and work in peace. [WaitForA]
That was the reason why she 
removed those worthless 
generals and soldiers. [WaitForA]
But, even knowing this, 
General Rucke provoked the 
soldiers into joining the coup. [WaitForA]
His only reason being because 
he wanted to take this country 
for himself. So do you think 
what he's doing is right? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Is that true? I don't like the 
army doing as they please. [WaitForA]
I understand. If you're going to
rescue the princess, let me 
help as well. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
