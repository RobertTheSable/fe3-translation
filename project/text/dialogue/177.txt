[ShowPortrait][18][04]Oh, Prince Marth. It's been a 
while since we met. [WaitForA]
There seems to be some 
commotion outside. What's 
going on? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Ah, Bantu! I didn't expect to 
meet you here. How is Tiki? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
That child isnt with me 
anymore. Gotoh took her back 
to the Ice Dragon Shrine. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ice Dragon Shrine? What kind 
of place is it? I've never 
heard of it. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
It's located in the northern 
icelands. However no normal 
person can reach there. [WaitForA]
Besides the hero Anri, no 
human has ever visited it. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Anri!? Then, could that place 
be the "Realm of the Gods" as 
described in the legends of 
Anri? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I've said all that I can say. If 
you want to learn more, you'll 
have to ask Gotoh. [WaitForA]
Actually, could you listen to a 
request of mine? My precious 
Firestone was stolen by 
thieves. [WaitForA]
If you can recover it for me, I 
will help you as best as I can. 
Thank you, Prince Marth. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
