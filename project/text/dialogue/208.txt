[ShowPortrait][8b][07]You are Princess Sheema? It's 
great to see you safe. [WaitForA]
I don't view Gra as an anemy. 
Gra and my country were 
originally one country. [WaitForA]
The country may have divided 
after Anri's death, but we 
always got on well as allies. [WaitForA]
But, in the previous war, I felt 
deeply regretful about things 
turning out the way they did. [WaitForA]
Princess Sheema, please allow 
us to be friends once again. I 
don't want to fight Gra. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][89][04]Prince Marth... Once I heard 
that you didn't attack my 
fleeing soldiers, I was really 
surprised. [WaitForA]
You truly are the second 
coming of King Anri. I trust 
you. [WaitForA]
Please... Treat the citizens of 
Gra... as if they were your 
citizens. [WaitForA]
I will hand my whole country to 
your care... Prince Marth. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
