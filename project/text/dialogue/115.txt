[ShowPortrait][00][07]General Camus. I don't want to 
fight you. [WaitForA]
You should understand that 
this battle is meaningless. [WaitForA]
Nyna also wants to see you. [WaitForA]
Please forget about the past, 
and drop your sword. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]

[ShowPortrait][4b][04]Prince Marth... It's already too 
late... [WaitForA]
My homeland, Grust, must help 
Doluna achieve its ambitions. [WaitForA]
It is my duty, as a member of 
the glorious Grustian Sable 
Order, to fight until the very 
end. [WaitForA]
And besides, I caused your 
father's death... [WaitForA]
Why don't we just end 
everything here?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][61][07]Wait Camus... I beg of you. [WaitForA]
Your fight with Prince Marth 
isn't what I wish to see. [WaitForA]
Please... I beg of you, help us...
No, help me.  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I'm sorry... Nyna. If possible, I 
would like that. [WaitForA]
But... Betraying my homeland, 
right as it nears ruin, is 
something that I cannot do. [WaitForA]
Nyna... Our days together may 
have been short, but I was 
very happy. [WaitForA]
...Farewell. 
I pray for your happiness. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
