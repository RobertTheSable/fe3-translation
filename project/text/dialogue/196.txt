[ShowPortrait][33][04]Prince Marth, you finally came![WaitForA]
I should have expected 
nothing less from the one who 
possesses the heroic bloodline 
of Anri.  [WaitForA]
To reward your courage, I will 
hand the Lightsphere to you. [WaitForA]
With this, the Darksphere will 
lose its power and it will no 
longer be impossible to fight 
Hardin. [WaitForA]
Also, about the Starsphere 
shards... [WaitForA]
Is that so. You couldn't find 
them all... [WaitForA]
There's nothing you can do 
about it... Please hand your 
collected shards to me. [WaitForA]
Tiki is sleeping in the room to 
the right. But since the shield 
isn't restored, I can't let you 
see her. [WaitForA]
That child is still developing. 
Without the Binding Shield she 
will begin to degenerate. [WaitForA]
Eventually she will become wild 
and attack humans. I cannot 
allow Tiki to awaken again. It 
is for her own good... [WaitForA]
Marth, once you've obtained 
all the treasures, head to the 
room to the left. I will be 
waiting for you... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
