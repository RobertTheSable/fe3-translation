[ShowPortrait][67][04]The deceased King Grust had 
two children: [WaitForA]
Princess Yumina and Prince 
Yubello, twins of 13 to 14 
years of age. [WaitForA]
The King was scared of 
Gharnef, so he sent the two to 
Khadein. [WaitForA]
I heard they were held as 
hostages and locked inside a 
dark room. [WaitForA]
When they were finally rescued 
by Wendell, they were on the 
brink of death. [WaitForA]
The bishop immediately took 
them to a monastery in 
Khadein to care for them. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
