[ShowPortrait][8b][04]I should have expected no less 
from Akaneia. They have such 
a powerful army. [WaitForA]
We won't be able to get close
so easily.[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]Hardin is gambling everything 
on this one battle, and he 
appears to have gathered the 
entire army of Akaneia here. [WaitForA]
But, any knights with a 
conscience already joined the 
coup and have nearly all been 
executed. [WaitForA]
All that remains are just weak 
mercenaries, so you don't 
need to fear them. [WaitForA]
Right now, many people's 
hearts have already swayed 
from Hardin, [WaitForA]
and the citizens welcome 
us as their liberation army. [WaitForA]
This should give us confidence 
like no other. Anyway, this is 
the last battle. [WaitForA]
Although it might take time, 
please take care while 
advancing. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I understand. Let's go, Jagen. I
am worried about Midia. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
