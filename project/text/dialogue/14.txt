[PlaySong][20][80][ShowPortrait][67][04]Citizens of Altea, please 
rescue Sister Lena. [WaitForA]
Miss Lena helped to cure the 
poor and sick. [WaitForA]
However, she didn't heed our 
warning and went to the 
dreaded Ghoul's Teeth. [WaitForA]
We haven't seen her since. [WaitForA]
They way Miss Lena treated us 
was like that of an angel. [WaitForA]
Please, you must rescue her. [WaitForA]
For this, we have gathered 
3000 Gold. [WaitForA]
We will leave Miss Lena to you. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
