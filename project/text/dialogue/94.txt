[ShowPortrait][61][07]Marth, so this is your 
homeland, Altea? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][00][10]Yes. It has already been 2 
years since it was occupied by 
the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
That day... I managed to 
escape to Talys, thanks to my 
sister, Elice's help.[WaitForA]
But she was captured by the 
Dolunian Empire in my place.[WaitForA]
Right now, where on earth 
could she be? ...I must rescue 
her from their hands.[WaitForA]
Okay, everybody move out! 
For the freedom and peace of 
our homeland, Altea!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
