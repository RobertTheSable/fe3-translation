[ShowPortrait][2f][07]Julian! Catria has finally 
brought the Altean knights 
here. [WaitForA]
I will go with them to rescue 
Princess Minerva. Please take 
Lena and hurry to safety. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][0f][04]That isn't possible, Palla. Miss 
Lena's gone missing... I'm not 
leaving just by myself. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh, Lena's also... Princess 
Maria has also vanished. Why 
are the clerics the only ones 
missing...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Anyway, I'm staying to search 
the village. So, apologies, but 
I can't help you rescue your 
princess. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Oh, it's alright. We should be 
able to save Minerva by 
ourselves. [WaitForA]
But Julian, although I know 
you're worried about Lena, 
don't push yourself. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Ah... I'm sorry, Palla. Say "hi" 
to Prince Marth for me. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
