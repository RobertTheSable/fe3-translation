[ShowPortrait][8b][04]That was a fierce battle. Is 
everybody alright? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]Don't worry, they have been 
awaiting this day for a long 
time. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Akaneia's actions were too 
cold-hearted. They even had 
innocent citizens killed. [WaitForA]
How can I apologise to the 
citizens...? I only bring trouble 
to everybody... [WaitForA]
Perhaps I'm not fit to protect 
this country. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No, your highness, you're 
wrong! [WaitForA]
Your highness, you have a 
gentle heart, so that is why no 
matter what hardships, we can 
endure them. [WaitForA]
We believe in your highness, 
so that is why we follow you. [WaitForA]
Your highness, please raise 
your spirit!! We still haven't 
reclaimed Altea castle. [WaitForA]
There are probably many 
enemies awaiting us, but this 
is our castle. [WaitForA]
We already know how to fight 
this battle. Well, Lord Marth! 
Let's go!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
