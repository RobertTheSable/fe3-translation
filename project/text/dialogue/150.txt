[ShowPortrait][1c][07]Lord Marth!! Great, so you are 
here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Catria!? I heard a rebellion 
broke out in Medon. Are you 
alright?[WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes. My sister, Palla, and I 
managed to escape, but 
Minerva was captured by the 
rebels...[WaitForA]
Marth, please rescue Minerva! 
If this continues, her life will 
be in danger! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Of course I will. Catria, please 
take me to where the princess 
is. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes! But we must break 
through the bordering forests 
in front of us... [WaitForA]
These forests are full of 
General Rucke's dracoknights. 
If we approach head on, we'll 
be discovered by them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Is that so...? Then we will 
march through the left or right 
side. [WaitForA]
I understand, Catria, leave 
everything to us! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
