[ShowPortrait][1e][05]General Harmein. I cannot go 
ahead with this battle. [WaitForA]
As an honourable knight of 
Medon, I wish to fight an open 
front battle. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][3b][04]But, Princess Minerva. Your 
Medonian army, at Aurelis, has 
already lost over half of its 
soldiers. [WaitForA]
To restore the army, we must 
bide for time at this castle. [WaitForA]
I came here following his 
highness's orders. And here, I 
would expect you to follow 
mine. [WaitForA]
You cannot have forgotten 
what will happen if you disobey 
the Empire. [WaitForA]
Your sister, Maria's life would 
have no guarantee. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[ShowPortrait][1e][05][ClearFrame]
...I understand. I will leave 
everything to you... [WaitForA]
But I don't believe this method 
will defeat the Altean 
knights... You will regret it in 
the end. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
