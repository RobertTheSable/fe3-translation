[ShowPortait][83][07]So you are Lord Marth. 
Currently the situation is 
relaxed. [WaitForA]
We have already subdued most 
of the rebels. All that remains 
is this fortress. [WaitForA]
Since you are here, I will leave 
the job of defeating the 
rebels' leader, General 
Lorenz, to you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][8b][04]Huh!? The leader of the rebels 
is General Lorenz!? [WaitForA]
Why would he rebel...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Oh... I don't know why.[WaitForA]
But it is a fact that he is 
hiding Grust's prince. [WaitForA]
He's probably dreaming of 
restoring the Kingdom of 
Grust. [WaitForA]
What a fool. He really thought 
his rebellion would be 
victorious? [WaitForA]
Lord Marth, you will kill Lorenz 
and bring back the hidden 
Grustian royal children. [WaitForA]
We will leave this place to you, 
and pursue the escaping 
rebels. [WaitForA]
We must show those Grustian 
fools the consequences of 
opposing us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
General Lang... 
What are you planning to do!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
If you want to know, I am going 
to slaughter the families of 
the rebels. [WaitForA]
Then we will burn down any 
villages that harboured the 
rebels. [WaitForA]
That will stop them from 
contemplating rebellion again. [WaitForA]
Hahaha! I can almost see the 
tears on the faces of those 
fools. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What?! How can you be so 
cruel... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Th-there's nothing wrong! [WaitForA]
You'd best follow my orders 
and not think about things too 
much. [WaitForA]
Or do you, also, intend to 
rebel against Akaneia!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What! Of course not... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Then you'd better listen to my 
orders!! [WaitForA]
Lord Marth, don't think too 
highly of yourself. [WaitForA]
In my eyes you are just the 
prince of a weak country. [WaitForA]
With its power, Akaneia can 
destroy your country at any 
time. Don't forget about this! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
