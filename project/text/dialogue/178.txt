[ShowPortrait][06][07]Mister Jeorge! Please wait a 
second! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][20][04]Huh? ...Gordin? Long time no 
see. [WaitForA]
You appear stronger, but has 
your archery improved? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, right now... I am 
recognised as the finest 
archer of Altea. [WaitForA]
It was all thanks to you, Mister
Jeorge, that I could become 
this strong.  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
So? Did you come all the way 
here so that you could duel 
with me? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Wh-what? Of course not! This 
might sound silly but... 
Can you come along with us 
again? [WaitForA]

I already swore an oath to 
Nyna, but I can't stand Hardin. [WaitForA]
He used his might to threaten 
other countries, and executed 
anybody who opposed him 
without question. [WaitForA]
Akaneia's army right now is 
just a bunch of paid savages 
with no dignity of a knight. [WaitForA]
I will draw my bow against my 
own country, to bring back the 
Kingdom of Akaneia of old. [WaitForA]
Gordin, I hope you can pass on 
my thoughts to Prince Marth. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]

Thank you, Mister Jeorge!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
