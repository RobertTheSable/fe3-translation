[ShowPortrait][4b][04]So you are Altea's Prince 
Marth...? [WaitForA]
Then, I have one request. This 
is a magic tome belonging to 
Akaneia's bishop Boah. [WaitForA]
Originally it was in the 
possession of Doluna's bishop 
Volzhin, but now it is in my 
hands. [WaitForA]
Can you return it to Boah for 
me? [WaitForA]
Also... Please take care of 
Princess Nyna... [WaitForA]
I hope that you can protect 
her personally. [WaitForA]
Well, I must leave. We will 
definitely meet again. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
