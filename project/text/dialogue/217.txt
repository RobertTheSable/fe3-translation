[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Jagen, it seems we've finally 
crossed the peak. Pales isn't 
far from here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][07]Yes, if we go down from here, 
we will reach the capital of 
Pales in an instant. [WaitForA]
Also, your highness, I just 
received news of an attempted 
coup in Pales. [WaitForA]
The knights and civilians who 
opposed Hardin's actions 
rebelled against him. [WaitForA]
It seems their leader was Lady 
Midia. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What! Midia...? What happened? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Unfortunately Lady Midia was 
defeated, and was captured... 
Each day many people are 
executed. [WaitForA]
It is only a matter of time 
before Lady Midia shares the 
same fate. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Damn, Hardin... I can't believe 
that he would do that. Alright, 
let's go and rescue Midia! [WaitForA]
We must hurry to Pales and 
end this once and for all. 
Jagen, let's go!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
