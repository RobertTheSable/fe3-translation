[ShowPortait][1b][07]Astram! Why are you here...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][2b][04]Midia? Is that you, Midia? [WaitForA]
Are you alright? [WaitForA]
It's great... to see you again. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Ah... Astram. You didn't know. [WaitForA]
The Altean army has already 
liberated Pales. [WaitForA]
We hostages were all freed, 
and now we're fighting 
together with Altea. [WaitForA]
So you don't need to help the 
enemy anymore. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really? That's great. [WaitForA]
In that case, I want to try my 
hand at challenging Doluna 
once again. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, from now on we'll be 
together. [WaitForA]
I'll definitely not leave your 
side again.[WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
