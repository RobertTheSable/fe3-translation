[ShowPortrait][62][04]Oh, Prince Marth, I am glad to 
see you're safe. [WaitForA]
We are all very grateful for 
your actions. [WaitForA]
Is that so...? [WaitForA]
You're finally heading out to 
Aurelis? [WaitForA]
In that case, I will send some 
soldiers to aid you. [WaitForA]
These men, led by Captain 
Ogma, are all brave warriors. [WaitForA]
I'm certain they will help you in
battle.   [WaitForA]
Before you go, I have some 
important advice for your 
highness. [WaitForA]
From now on, during your 
highness' travels, you will 
surely find many people who 
despise the Dolunian Empire.[WaitForA]
Some of them are hiding in
villages, while others have 
been captured by enemies. [WaitForA]
There may even be some that 
have been forced to work for 
Doluna. [WaitForA]
Finding these people and
fighting together with them is
crucial. [WaitForA]
Do you understand me, Prince 
Marth...? [WaitForA]
Well, the time has come! [WaitForA]
You must be determined during 
your journey. [WaitForA]
Good luck! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
