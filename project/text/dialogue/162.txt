[ShowPortrait][8c][05]Marth!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][90][06]Shiida!? What, even you've 
come here...? Could it be that 
something's happened to 
Altea? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Marth... Altea... Altea was 
ambushed by the imperial 
army...  [WaitForA]
After being ambushed by the 
Akeneia, Gra and Aurelis 
united army, the Altean 
knights were decimated... [WaitForA]
Even the castle has fallen... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Wh-what!? How could... Altea... 
Jagen, what's going on? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][02][05]It is regrettable... What I 
feared the most has happened. [WaitForA]
Emperor Hardin has listened to 
Lang's words and declared us 
traitors. [WaitForA]
Your highness, please forgive 
me. It is because of me that 
this has happened. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No, I still cannot believe it. 
That Hardin would attack our 
country. [WaitForA]
Did Hardin really believe Lang, 
and thought that we wished to 
rebel against him? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No, even if that was the case, 
everything happened too fast. [WaitForA]
If they hadn't prepared in 
advance, they wouldn't have 
been able to attack us that 
quickly. [WaitForA]
I fear... The Grustian 
expedition was a trap they 
planned for us all along, as 
well as the rebellion in Medon... [WaitForA]
They wanted us to leave Altea, 
to divide our army's strength. [WaitForA]
Hardin had already decided 
upon this action from the 
beginning. [WaitForA]
What happened with Lang was 
just an excuse to attack our 
country. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No, that can't be right! So 
you're saying Hardin attacked 
our country for no reason? [WaitForA]
And everything was a trap 
that he set up for us? [WaitForA]
I don't believe it. I don't 
believe that Hardin would do 
that... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness, regardless, 
our country has been attacked 
by Akaneia. [WaitForA]
Not only that, but we were 
ambushed without prior 
warning. [WaitForA]
That, to us knights, is the 
most dishonourable action one 
could take. [WaitForA]
In that case, we have no 
choice but to fight back with 
our full strength. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Damn, Hardin... Why... Why did 
you... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness... [WaitForA]
Shiida, what about the 
others? Is Elice safe? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8c][05]Elice... She agreed to be their 
hostage, to allow me to 
escape... [WaitForA]
The others... I don't know... 
Abel and Est were still fighting 
the last time I saw them... [WaitForA]
Marth... I'm sorry. Only I 
escaped, but I had to so I 
could warn you.. So... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Shiida... Don't cry. I 
understand. It's great that 
you're safe at least. [WaitForA]
I should be the one 
apologising. It was because of 
me that you experienced such 
terrible events... [WaitForA]
I will reclaim Altea. Even if I 
must fight Hardin to take it 
back!![WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
