[ShowPortait][8b][07]Tiki!? Are you alright... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][8f][04]Uh... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Tiki, it's me, Marth. Hey, open 
your eyes! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Marth... [WaitForA]
[_17][ef][ff].....! 
[_16][10][00]Oh Marth!! You came! You 
came to see Tiki!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, I hadn't seen Tiki in a 
long time. Are you feeling well? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Uh... No. The bishop told me 
that I had to sleep again. [WaitForA]
But I don't want to... Because 
when I sleep I'm always alone. [WaitForA]
During my sleep, I dreamt many 
nightmares. [WaitForA]
There, I became a wild dragon, 
like those poor Fire Dragons 
and Ice Dragons. [WaitForA]
I attacked humans, and I killed 
them. No... No... When I awoke I 
was all alone in the dark 
room... [WaitForA]
I felt so strange, but also 
very scared... So very 
scared... But I couldn't leave 
that room. [WaitForA]
I cried many times, and then 
Uncle Bantu would come to 
comfort me as usual. [WaitForA]
One day he took me away, and 
took me to a human village. [WaitForA]
Living in that village was very 
fun, and everybody treated me 
well... [WaitForA]
In the short time, until I was 
discovered by Gharnef, I felt 
really happy. [WaitForA]
I don't want to sleep anymore...
I feel that if I close my eyes 
once more, I will be unable to 
open them ever again.  [WaitForA]
I don't want that. I want to live
with everyone, I don't want to 
sleep again!  [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Tiki, it's alright now. I will 
protect you, so don't cry... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Really...? I won't need to see 
those scary dreams again!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
That's right! Once the shield is 
restored, Tiki can live 
together with the rest of us. [WaitForA]
Don't worry, believe in me! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Ah! I'm so happy!! Thank you, 
Marth! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
