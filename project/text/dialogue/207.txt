[ShowPortait][26][07]Princess Sheema, it seems the 
Altean army has arrived. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][89][04]Really...? It's already the end. [WaitForA]
Samson, I have brought you 
much trouble. I need to watch 
the final days of my Kingdom 
of Gra. You may leave now. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Princess, isn't it already 
enough? Shouldn't you despise 
King Jiol for forcefully taking 
your mother? [WaitForA]
Isn't that why you hid at Pales 
and stayed away from this 
country? [WaitForA]
Right now you are just being 
tricked by Hardin, and being 
used by him. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Perhaps. [WaitForA]
I heard that the people of Gra 
wished for the restoration of 
the country, and that's why I 
agreed to help him. [WaitForA]
However Hardin is only 
interested in using us. [WaitForA]
He would just throw us away 
like rubbish the moment we 
became useless to him. [WaitForA]
Still, I will not leave! How can I 
just abandon those fighting 
for my sake!? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Impossible... How can our fresh 
recruits resist Altea's 
elites...? [WaitForA]
Fine, if you're staying, I will 
also stay to the end. This 
could be interesting. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Samson... Why are you doing 
this? Aren't you mercenaries 
only interested in being paid 
with gold? [WaitForA]
I no longer have money to give 
you... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I don't know why either. It's 
just... Sometimes men feel like 
there are things that they 
must do. [WaitForA]
Also, I want to see how that 
kid fights this battle. If he 
truly is a hero, perhaps your 
mind may be changed... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][2e]
