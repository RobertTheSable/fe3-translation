[ShowPortrait][33][04]Marth. You truly are a hero for 
being able to reach here. [WaitForA]
In the past I used to hate 
these stupid humans, and so I 
cut off communications with 
them. [WaitForA]
However, after seeing you, I 
have now realised that humans 
aren't a lost hope. [WaitForA]
Go forth! The deities' chosen 
one, Altea's Prince of Light. [WaitForA]
Send the Shadow Dragon, 
Medeus, back to the eternal 
darkness once again!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
