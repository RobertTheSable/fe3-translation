[ShowPortait][8b][04]This is the Ice Dragon Shrine. 
Anri's final destination... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][02][07]Yes. It was here that Anri 
obtained the Falchion, which 
he used to defeat Medeus with. [WaitForA]
Then, encouraged by the 
citizens of Altea, he became 
their first king. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
But, in the end he wasn't able 
to be with Artemis... Why? Why 
weren't they loving together? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
The nobles of Akaneia didn't 
want Anri, a former peasant, 
to become their own king. [WaitForA]
Instead they encouraged the 
princess to marry the leader 
of the liberation army, Duke 
Cartas. [WaitForA]
Princess Artemis was unable 
to refuse. [WaitForA]
[SetColor][00][2c]"The bearer of the Fire 
Emblem, must give their life to 
the royal family". [WaitForA]
[SetColor][00][24]That is a saying passed down 
unchangingly by the Akaneia 
royal family. [WaitForA]
The princess didn't tell Anri 
anything and accepted 
Cartas's engagement. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
How could she...? That was 
unfair to Anri. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What was worse was that the 
princess died immediately 
after giving birth to her 
newborn prince. [WaitForA]
Also King Anri never married in 
his life. The Kingdom of Altea 
was succeeded by his younger 
brother, King Marcelus... [WaitForA]
That is to say, your 
highness's great grandfather. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Such a tragic tale... So that 
was Artemis's fate? All 
because of the curse of the 
Fire Emblem...? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
