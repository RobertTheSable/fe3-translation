[ShowPortait][10][07]Matthis, brother! [WaitForA]
Brother, it's me, Lena. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortait][2c][04]Ah, Lena!? Why are you 
here...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I was captured by the Ghoul's 
Teeth bandits, but the Alteans 
rescued me. [WaitForA]
But, brother, why are you in 
the army? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
After you fled from Prince
Michalis, Medon became more 
and more ruthless. [WaitForA]
The prince despised me, so he 
forced me to join the army and 
fight here. [WaitForA]
I detest fighting, but if I don't 
cooperate, they'll execute me. 
I don't really have a choice. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
No, brother. You should have 
been brave and walked on your 
own path! [WaitForA]
It was Medon that was wrong, 
for allying with the Dolunian
Empire and causing its people
to suffer. [WaitForA]
What they're doing is 
deplorable. [WaitForA]
Brother, it's not too late. 
Come with us, and join the 
Altean Alliance. [WaitForA]
Everybody will welcome you, 
because they're all good 
people. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Really? I understand. [WaitForA]
Since I'm going to die anyway, I
might as well die a glorious 
death.  [WaitForA]
However I heard that you 
flatly denied the prince's 
proposal. [WaitForA]
My life is going to be hard with 
a sister like you. [WaitForA]
That said, you're still a woman. 
Are there any guys that take 
your fancy? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Huh...? No, there's nobody... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Huh? I was so sure there was. [WaitForA]
Nevermind, you've already 
reached the age to freely 
love. [WaitForA]
But, remember what I am about 
to say: Never fall in love with 
a thief. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
...Huh...? But... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Okay, that's good. [WaitForA]
Well, Lena, don't push yourself 
too hard. [WaitForA]
I'll just go and say my 
farewells to the Medonian 
army. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
