[ShowPortrait][02][07]Your highness, we've finally 
got rid of the thieves, but the 
temple has been completely 
wrecked by them and there's [WaitForA]
nothing left there. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Really, even the Fane of 
Raman has been reduced to 
ruins? This is a frightful age 
we're in. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, I bet even the Guardian 
God Naga is furious. It's as if 
we're heading towards the ruin 
of this world. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Jagen, you know of the tales 
of Naga? Can you tell me what 
you know of them? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes, but I only know a little... 
This occured almost a 
thousand years ago. [WaitForA]
Back then there were no 
kingdoms in this continent, 
and people lived separately in 
small villages. [WaitForA]
At that time there existed 
frightful monsters, which 
would occasionally attack 
humans. [WaitForA]
At one stage, only around 
10,000 humans remained and 
mankind was nearing 
extinction. [WaitForA]
It was said that the surviving 
humans prayed to the deities 
for help. [WaitForA]
The deities answered their 
wishes and sent a gigantic 
warrior to the earth. [WaitForA]
The warrior held in his right 
hand a sword of light. In his 
left hand was a shield 
encrusted with five jewels. [WaitForA]
After many violent battles, 
the monsters were defeated 
and the warrior returned to 
the heavens... [WaitForA]
That warrior was the Guardian 
God Naga, who was worshipped 
in this very temple. [WaitForA]
[SetColor][00][2c]"He assumed the form of a 
god, and became our Guardian 
God..."[WaitForA]
[SetColor][00][24]Your highness, you should 
know that line from the first 
chapter of the Raman Bible. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm, I have heard that before. 
The tales of Naga... [WaitForA][_89][0d][80][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
[_10][19]Your highness, we must cross
Chiasmir Bridge next. [WaitForA]
If we don't hurry, the enemy 
will gain full control of it and 
we won't be able to cross. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hmm,that's true. That bridge 
could become very dangerous. [WaitForA]
Okay, tell all the troops that 
we're going to break across 
Chiasmir Bridge, and make 
sure that nobody falls behind! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
