[ShowPortrait][31][07]Lord Marth! It's you... [WaitForA]
Although I knew the enemy's 
reinforcements had come, but 
I didn't expect it was you... [WaitForA]
It is a shame, that we must 
fight Altea... And fight against 
your highness... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Please wait. I don't intend to 
fight with you. [WaitForA]
From the citizens I have 
discovered disturbing facts 
about the atrocities 
performed by the occupation [WaitForA]
army. [WaitForA]
I will inform Emperor Hardin 
about these facts. If I meet 
him, I will definitely be able to 
rescue Grust. [WaitForA]
So, please, put away your 
weapon. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Your highness... I appreciate 
your favour. But that is 
impossible. [WaitForA]
Your highness, you don't know 
a thing. [WaitForA]
You think that somebody like 
Hardin would send a heartless 
man like Lang here for no 
reason? [WaitForA]
He wanted to provoke us into 
rebelling, so that the Kingdom 
of Grust would be completely 
destroyed and become ruled by [WaitForA]
the Empire. [WaitForA]
That is the reason why he sent 
such a cold-blooded man here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What? Why would he!? I cannot 
possibly believe that Hardin 
would do such a thing. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I didn't expect you to accept 
the truth so quickly. However, 
since he became Emperor he 
has completely changed. [WaitForA]
He is no longer the Hardin that 
your highness once knew. [WaitForA]
Anyway, I believe we're 
finished here... However, your 
highness, I have just one last 
request. [WaitForA]
In this fortress, Grust's royal 
princess and prince are hiding. [WaitForA]
Please save those children. If 
you can promise me that, I will 
have no regrets. [WaitForA]
Lord Marth... Let's just say 
that in exchange for my life, 
these children... I will hand 
them in your care... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
