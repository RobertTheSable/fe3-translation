[ShowPortrait][19][04]Prince Marth, we are 
mercenaries guarding Warren 
town. [WaitForA]
The Grustian knights have 
gathered from the western 
forts and have us completely 
surrounded. [WaitForA]
Right now, we are in a very 
dangerous situation. [WaitForA]
Luckily, the eastern castle is 
weakly guarded, so we should 
be able to subdue it easily. We 
will also aid you. [WaitForA]
Please hurry and escape to 
the eastern castle. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
