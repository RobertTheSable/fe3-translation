[ShowPortrait][4e][04]Marth. [WaitForA]
You've finally come. [WaitForA]
I, Pontifex Gharnef, have been
waiting for a long time...  [WaitForA]
It is a shame, but to secure my
grasp upon this world you must 
die. [WaitForA]
Haha... Medeus is under my 
control, there is nothing to 
fear. [WaitForA]
As long as I have the Falchion 
and Imhullu, even he cannot 
oppose me. [WaitForA]
Well, Marth, you must do battle 
with my images. [WaitForA]
The Falchion will be yours only 
if you can defeat the real me. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
