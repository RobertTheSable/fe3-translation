[ShowPortrait][0f][07]Aren't you Rickard? What are
you doing here? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][07][04]Oh, big bro Julian! It's been a 
while.  [WaitForA]
Heh, it's a little embarrassing. 
I came to the castle to steal, 
but I slipped up and got myself 
caught. [WaitForA]
But, big bro, what are you 
doing here...? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I... I'm not a thief anymore. I'm, 
er, an ally of justice now. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Oh? Tsk tsk! You're probably 
being deceived by a woman. Big 
bro has always been 
intimidated by pretty women. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
F-fool!! My, uh, sense of 
justice was awakened, that's 
all... [WaitForA]
Nevermind. Anyhow, from now 
on you're going to be a 
companion of mine. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Pfft! You're always so 
selfish... Okay. One, I have 
time. And two, since big bro 
asked of me... [WaitForA]
I understand. I will help big bro.
But you must also help me.  [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
