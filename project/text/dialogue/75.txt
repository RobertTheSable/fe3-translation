[ShowPortait][1b][06]Boah, the people in the castle 
are panicking. What exactly is 
going on? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][24][07]Hmm, perhaps Nyna has 
brought the liberation army 
here. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][1b][06]Huh, really? Then perhaps we 
can be saved. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][24][07]But, Midia, we can't get 
complacent right now. [WaitForA]
If this continues, the enemy 
will decide to finish us off. [WaitForA]
Without weapons, we're sitting 
ducks. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][1b][06]But, Boah. We've finally 
chased the enemy away from 
Akaneia. [WaitForA]
Even if we die here, we should 
have no regrets. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][24][07][ClearFrame]
Haha... You're still so strong. [WaitForA]
Still, if you die, Astram will be 
very sad. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortait][1b][06].....Yes... I just want to see him 
one last time. 
That is my final wish. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][24][07][ClearFrame]
Well, Midia, for that wish you 
must endure to the end. You 
mustn't give up.[WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
