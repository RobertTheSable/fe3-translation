[ShowPortrait][0f][06]Hurry, Miss Lena! If you aren't 
quick, we'll both be finished. [WaitForA]
I heard the Altean knights 
have arrived towards the 
south. [WaitForA]
Now's our chance to escape. 
Please hang on, you can do it! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortrait][10][07]I'm sorry... But, I still haven't 
found my precious Mend 
staff... [WaitForA]
Julian! Forget about me and 
flee yourself! [WaitForA]
If it's just you, I can teleport 
you away to safety with my 
Warp staff. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[ShowPortrait][0f][06][ClearFrame]
How is that going to help? [WaitForA]
Don't you understand why I 
betrayed them in the first 
place? [WaitForA]
...Anyway. I will find that staff 
later. For now, let's just make 
our escape! [WaitForA]
Hurry! Go!! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
