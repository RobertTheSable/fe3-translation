[ShowPortrait][72][04]Do you need a slave? [WaitForA]
Right now we only have 
weakling kids for sale, but we 
can sell them to you for a 
cheap price. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][00][07]You are selling children... How 
dare you!! [WaitForA]
If you want to live, release the
children, and leave this place  
at once!! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Ah, the Altean army!!? [WaitForA]
Help! [WaitForA]

You must have suffered, but 
it's alright now. Please return 
safely to your homes. [WaitForA]
.....Why aren't you leaving? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ShowPortrait][73][04]I... I no longer have a home to 
go back to. [WaitForA]

[ClearFrame]
Ah... Huh? [WaitForA]
You are a girl, but why are you 
wearing boys' clothes? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I am bishop Miloah's daughter, 
Linde. [WaitForA]
I dressed up as a boy to 
escape from Gharnef. [WaitForA]
But... Then I was caught by the 
slave merchants... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Really? So you are Miloah's 
daughter... But you can relax 
now. [WaitForA]
Nyna has also been worried 
about you. [WaitForA]
From now on, we will protect 
you... So you won't be in 
danger any longer. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No!! Lord Marth, I want to fight 
as well. [WaitForA]
I have my father's Aura tome, 
which he gave me. As long as 
Nyna permits, I can use it. [WaitForA]
I want to personally defeat 
Gharnef, to avenge my father. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
