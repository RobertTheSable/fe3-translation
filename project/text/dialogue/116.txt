[_88][00][_89][0a][80][ShowPortrait][00][04]Nyna... I'm sorry. [WaitForA]
I couldn't fulfil my promise to 
you... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][61][07]No, Marth... You have also 
suffered. [WaitForA]
I'm sorry. ...Really. [WaitForA]
I already knew that this would 
happen. [WaitForA]
Since the time I handed the 
Emblem to you, I knew that... [WaitForA]
The Fire Emblem must be used 
to restore the royal family. [WaitForA]
But there is a price to pay, 
which is to lose your most 
loved one. [WaitForA]
That is the curse of the 
Emblem... [WaitForA]
The fate of Artemis. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
