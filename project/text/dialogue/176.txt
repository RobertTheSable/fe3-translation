[ShowPortrait][03][04]Your highness, you're safe! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Cain! You're safe as well? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Mmm, I had to break through 
the enemy to get here. But, 
they have already secured the 
northern bridge now. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
It doesn't matter. We'll crush 
them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No, that's not possible. Hardin 
is being protected by a 
mysterious power. [WaitForA]
We can't touch him. Basically, 
if we fight now we can't hope 
to win. [WaitForA]
You should head towards the 
north western fort and escape 
by ship to the Khadein desert. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][02][06]Your highness, the 
mercenaries towards the 
south are beginning to move 
out. [WaitForA]
This truly isn't the time to 
fight. We should do what Cain 
says, and escape to the 
Khadein desert. [WaitForA]
Afterwards, we can formulate 
a new plan... [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][8b][07]Really...? Even though it's 
regrettable, that's our only 
choice... [WaitForA]
Troops, we will march to the 
north western fort! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
