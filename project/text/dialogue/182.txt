[ShowPortait][4c][04]Minerva. If you wait in this 
village, you should be able to 
meet Marth. [WaitForA]
Although I don't like that boy, 
he is indeed of heroic calibre. 
You should aid him. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][1e][07]Brother, what are you going to 
do next? If possible, you 
should come with us... [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I don't plan on doing that. I 
just want to find Maria, and 
bring her back to Medon. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Brother, you've changed... Or 
should I say, you've changed 
to how you used to be. [WaitForA]
So you truly were under the 
control of Gharnef's dark 
magic. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
No, it wasn't that. [WaitForA]
Wanting to destroy that 
prideful Akaneia, and allow 
Medon to become the 
conqueror of this world, was [WaitForA]
my own idea. [WaitForA]
I originally planned to ally with 
Doluna to destroy Akaneia, 
and then later join forces with 
Grust's Camus to defeat 
Doluna. [WaitForA]
But father didn't agree with 
me, and finally he sent me 
away. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
So that's why you killed 
father? You idiot... Didn't you 
know that it was a trap set by 
Gharnef? [WaitForA]
Father was indeed very strict 
towards you. However that 
was because he loved you. Why 
didn't you understand? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
That's enough, Minerva. I'm 
not stupid. When I was struck 
by your lance, I was just 
outside death's door. [WaitForA]
Later, when I found 
consciousness, in front of me I
saw a crying Maria, praying to 
the deities.  [WaitForA]
She saved me, by selflessly 
and tirelessly taking care of 
me, even though her face was 
completely in tears. [WaitForA]
I don't believe in deities, but 
at that time she truly looked 
like an angel. [WaitForA]
The way I treated Maria, and 
yet she still cried for me... 
Minerva, I must go. [WaitForA]
I must rescue Maria. That is 
the only thing I can do to 
repent! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
