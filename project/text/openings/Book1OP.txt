In the distant past, the 
continent of Akaneia was 
invaded by the Dolunian 
Empire, led by the Manakete [MapWaitForA]
King, Medeus. [MapWaitForA]
The people lived in fear and
despair.[MapWaitForA]
The Holy Kingdom of Akaneia, 
which had always guarded the 
world, was also destroyed by 
the horrific power of the [MapWaitForA]
Shadow Dragon. [MapWaitForA]
The world was facing ruin. [MapWaitForA]
However... A miracle occured. [MapWaitForA]
Anri was a youth from the town 
of Altea. [MapWaitForA]
He went on a perilous journey 
to obtain the divine sword of 
light, Falchion. [MapWaitForA]
And used it to challenge and 
defeat the Shadow Dragon, 
Medeus. [MapWaitForA]
With Medeus's fall, the 
Dolunian Empire was 
vanquished.[MapWaitForA]
The Kingdom of Akaneia was
restored, and the world 
entered an age of peace. [MapWaitForA]
Taking lead from the Kingdom 
of Altea, many other countries 
also began to rebuild 
themselves.[MapWaitForA]
But, 100 years after the war 
with Doluna.[MapWaitForA]
After many years had passed, 
Medeus resurrected at Doluna. [MapWaitForA]
He allied with the neighbouring 
kingdoms of Grust and Medon, 
and restored the Dolunian 
Empire.[MapWaitForA]
Also he joined forces with 
Khadein's Pontifex Gharnef, 
who shared the same ambitions 
of ruling the world as him, and [MapWaitForA]
launched an attack on the
Kingdom of Akaneia. [MapWaitForA]
Akeneia fought to the death, 
but under Grust's general 
Camus and Medeus's might 
they suffered terrible losses. [MapWaitForA]
Aside from Princess Nyna, the 
royal family was wiped out. [MapWaitForA]
Altea's King Cornelius, who 
possessed the bloodline of 
Anri, left to defeat Medeus. [MapWaitForA]
He took the Falchion, the 
divine sword of legends, to 
battle, but was betrayed by 
Altea's ally, Gra, and died in [MapWaitForA]
battle. [MapWaitForA]
Following him, the Kingdom of 
Altea also fell. [MapWaitForA]
Prince Marth, just 14 years of 
age, managed to escape with 
the help of his elder sister, 
Princess Elice. [MapWaitForA]
And he fled to the distant 
island country of Talys... # length: 1813
