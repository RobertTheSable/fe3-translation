mission. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][8b][06]General Lang, what is it this 
time? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
...Well... My castle was 
attacked, and the captured 
Grustian royal children appear 
to have been taken. [WaitForA]
The culprit seems to have 
escaped to Medon. [WaitForA]
Your highness, you will chase 
after them and bring back the 
royal children! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What!? Really, those children... 
They're safe... That's great. [WaitForA]
General Lang, I will not follow 
your orders. We're going back 
to our own country. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What did you say!? You're 
going to disobey my orders? 
So you were behind it, I knew 
it. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
What? What do you mean? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
The one who escaped with the 
royal children was Ogma, the 
Talys mercenary. [WaitForA]
He once served under your 
highness, correct? [WaitForA]
It was you who ordered Ogma 
to escape with those two! [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
I don't know a thing. But if I 
could, I would have done just 
that. [WaitForA]
Since that time, when I 
couldn't rescue the two, I 
have been deeply regretful. [WaitForA]
Even if I must fight you, I will 
still rescue them. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
What, you! Your actions are 
treasonous! Do you want me to 
inform Emperor Hardin about 
this!? [WaitForA][_0c][01][ClearFrame]
Go ahead. We're planning on 
going to Pales anyway. We will 
inform Hardin and Nyna of the 
truth, and of your crimes. [WaitForA]
Jagen, I'm sorry, but I can no 
longer stay silent. I want to 
find Ogma, so we can rescue 
those children. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortait][02][06]I understand. You've had to 
stay patient for so long. I 
have also reached my 
limits. [WaitForA]
Lang, you have constantly 
mocked our prince of Altea 
with your actions. [WaitForA]
Even if his highness could 
forgive you, I certainly could 
not. [WaitForA]
Come, draw your sword. Even 
though I, Jagen, am old, I will 
not lose to somebody like you. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Wh-what...! Damn, you... I will 
not forgive you for this!! [WaitForA]
I will inform the Emperor, and 
turn Altea into dust! Mark my 
words! [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
[CloseFrame][03]
