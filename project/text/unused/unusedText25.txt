[ShowPortrait][16][04]Wolf, Sedgar, Vyland. Is this 
really okay...? Can we really 
fight this battle? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][14][07]Roshea! What are you trying to 
say? [WaitForA]
Look, the Altean army is 
marching along the narrow 
mountain road. Now's our only 
chance to defeat them. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][17][06]Yes, Roshea. We swore that we 
could sacrifice our lives for 
Lord Hardin. [WaitForA]
Lord Hardin was the one who 
freed us plains people from 
slavery. [WaitForA]
If we don't fight Altea now,
Pales will fall. Do you want 
Lord Hardin to be defeated by 
them? [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][15][07]That's right! Prince Marth 
wants to destroy Akaneia, and 
conquer the world. [WaitForA]
And that's why he joined 
forces with Medon to crush 
Grust. Now he even has Gra 
under his rule. [WaitForA]
If we don't do something, the 
whole world will fall under his 
control. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
I still don't believeit. I cannot 
believe Prince Marth would 
have such ambitions. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][03]
[SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][14][07]What? Are you saying that 
Emperor Hardin lied? Do you 
think that he would stoop to 
such a low!? [WaitForA]
Enough, Roshea!! You 
disappoint me, if you want to 
betray us then go ahead. [WaitForA]
Sedgar, Vyland, let's go. If 
we're too slow, they will pass 
us. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Hey, wait! I won't betray you. I 
understand... I'll go. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
