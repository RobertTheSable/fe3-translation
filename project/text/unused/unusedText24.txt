[ShowPortrait][8b][04]Wow... To think there could be 
a place like this... 
I can feel my whole body 
burning up just standing here. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ShowPortrait][28][07]Flame Barrel... The graveyard 
of Fire Dragons. [WaitForA]
This is where Fire Dragons 
that have degenerated wait to 
die. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Degenerated...? What does 
that mean? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
The dragon tribe is currently 
facing extinction. [WaitForA]
If dragons do not seal their 
true form within 
dragonstones, they will lose 
their mind and become wild. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
So that's why they became 
Manaketes? [WaitForA]
Xane, can you tell me 
everything you know about the 
dragon tribe? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Okay... Many tens of 
thousands of years ago the 
dragon tribe lived on this 
world, and built their own [WaitForA]
civilisation. [WaitForA]
They were much wiser 
and stronger than humans. But,
from nowhere, the day of ruin 
came. [WaitForA]
First they could not give birth 
anymore and then they lost 
their minds, becoming wild 
beasts that destroyed [WaitForA]
everything in their path. [WaitForA]
The elders said the dragon 
tribe was reaching its last 
days. [WaitForA]
We had no choice, except to 
abandon our identities as 
dragons and live on as humans. 
The dragon tribe panicked. [WaitForA]
Those who trusted the elders 
sealed their dragon form 
inside stones and assumed 
human form. [WaitForA]
But there were some who could 
not abandon their pride as 
dragons and did not become 
human. [WaitForA]
In the end they lost their mind 
and became wild. [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][00]
[ClearFrame]
Just like these Fire 
Dragons? [WaitForA][SwitchFrame][01]
[ClearFrame]
Yes. There are more like them, 
but they're all just a pack of 
wild beasts who can no longer 
return to sanity... [WaitForA]
These ones have become the 
pets of the Fire Clan, who rule 
these mountains. [WaitForA]
Well, Marth. Let's talk about 
the rest later, let's go. [WaitForA]
The Fire Clan are nasty stuff. 
If we don't hurry up, we'll 
become dinner for their Fire 
Dragons. [WaitForA][CloseFrame][02]
