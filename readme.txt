        - Overhauled the v1.1 patch to not overwrite the underlying differences between v1.1 and v1.0.

Instructions:
    The ZIP file includes a transition path from v0.14 of the Quirino patch. No 1.1 transition patch was included because the Quirino 1.1 patch converts the ROM to 1.0.

    The from_jp folder includes .ips patches for Japanese headered and unheadered ROMs of both v1.0 and v1.1 of Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo.
    To see which version of FE3 you have, open the ROM in SNES9x and check the Revision under File -> Show Rom Info.
    
    Apply the patch to an untranslated FE3 ROM. You can use a patcher like Lunar IPS or Flips, or put the patch file in the 
    same directory as your ROM and give it the same name as your ROM. Most modern SNES emulators should support softpatching.
    
    This is a beta release, so please report any issues you find. Reporting issues with the 1.1 patch would be
    especially appreciated. Please do not request any script changes or report anything else besides technical mistakes.
